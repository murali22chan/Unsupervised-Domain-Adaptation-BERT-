48581,18301,"Please explain what is ""Animal cognition""","Animal cognition encompasses the mental capacities of non-human animals including insect cognition. The study of animal conditioning and learning used in this field was developed from comparative psychology. It has also been strongly influenced by research in ethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology;  the alternative name cognitive ethology is sometimes used. Many behaviors associated with the term animal intelligence are also subsumed within animal cognition.Researchers have examined animal cognition in mammals (especially primates, cetaceans, elephants, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cattle, raccoons and rodents), birds (including parrots, fowl, corvids and pigeons), reptiles (lizards, snakes, and turtles), fish and invertebrates (including cephalopods, spiders and insects).",0,wikipedia_csai
48582,18301,"Please explain what is ""Animal cognition""","Animal cognition refers to the mental capacities of non-human animals. It includes the ability to process information, perceive and attend to stimuli, learn and remember, solve problems, and make decisions. These cognitive abilities are thought to be mediated by brain functions, and research on animal cognition seeks to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying these abilities.Studies of animal cognition have been conducted in a variety of species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. These studies have revealed that many animals are capable of sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. For example, some animals are able to use tools, communicate with others, and navigate complex environments.Understanding animal cognition can provide insight into the evolution of cognitive abilities in humans and other animals, and can also inform the development of animal-friendly practices in fields such as animal welfare, conservation, and animal-assisted therapy.",1,wikipedia_csai
48583,18302,"Please explain what is ""Human intelligence""","Human intelligence is the intellectual capability of humans, which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness. High intelligence is associated with better outcomes in life.Through intelligence, humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, apply logic and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, plan, innovate, solve problems, make decisions, retain information, and use language to communicate. There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence is measured, ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed upon birth, or that it is malleable and can change depending on an individual's mindset and efforts. Several subcategories of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence or social intelligence, are heavily debated as to whether they are traditional forms of intelligence. They are generally thought to be distinct processes that occur, though there is speculation that they tie into traditional intelligence more than previously suspected.",0,wikipedia_csai

Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the surroundings. Based on the model, the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, etc.) and obstacles. [10][11]Once the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to impact the automobile industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields. Autonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels,[12] according to a system developed by SAE International (SAE J3016). [13] The SAE levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 – no automation; Level 1 – hands on/shared control; Level 2 – hands off; Level 3 – eyes off; Level 4 – mind off, and Level 5 – steering wheel optional.As of December 2022[update], vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor.

48603,18315,"Please explain what is ""Go (game)""","Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.The playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections (points) of a board. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone or group is captured. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move. When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also be terminated by resignation.The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. However, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard by the time the game reached Korea in the 5th century CE and Japan in the 7th century CE.Go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan[10] (c. 4th century BCE). [11]Despite its relatively simple rules, Go is extremely complex. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately 2.1×10170,[12][a] which is vastly greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, estimated to be of the order of 1080.

48605,18316,"Please explain what is ""AI effect""","The AI effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence.Author Pamela McCorduck writes: ""It's part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something—play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems—there was a chorus of critics to say, 'that's not thinking'."" Researcher Rodney Brooks complains: ""Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation. '""""The AI effect"" is that line of thinking, the tendency to redefine AI to mean: ""AI is anything that has not been done yet."" This is the common public misperception, that as soon as AI successfully solves a problem, that solution method is no longer within the domain of AI.McCorduck calls it an ""odd paradox"" that ""practical AI successes, computational programs that actually achieved intelligent behavior, were soon assimilated into whatever application domain they were found to be useful in, and became silent partners alongside other problem-solving approaches, which left AI researchers to deal only with the 'failures', the tough nuts that couldn't yet be cracked. ""When IBM's chess-playing computer Deep Blue succeeded in defeating Garry Kasparov in 1997, people complained that it had only used ""brute force methods"" and it wasn't real intelligence. Fred Reed writes:  Tesler's Theorem  is:Douglas Hofstadter quotes this as do many other commentators.When problems have not yet been formalised, they can still be characterised by a model of computation that includes human computation. The computational burden of a problem is split between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by a human.

48606,18316,"Please explain what is ""AI effect""","The ""AI effect"" refers to the phenomenon where people underestimate the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) because they perceive it as being similar to their own thought processes and behaviors. This can lead to a tendency to attribute intelligent behavior to other factors, such as the programmer or the underlying algorithms, rather than the AI system itself.The AI effect can lead people to overestimate their own abilities and underestimate the potential of AI systems. For example, if a person is able to perform a task with relative ease, they may assume that the task is not particularly difficult or intelligent and therefore attribute their success to their own abilities rather than recognizing the potential of the AI system that may be assisting them.Overall, the AI effect can be a barrier to understanding and appreciating the capabilities of AI systems, and can lead to a lack of appreciation for the value that AI can bring to various fields.",1,wikipedia_csai

48609,18319,"Please explain what is ""Symbolic AI""","In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel's Checker's Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition. [10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning. [11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant's PAC learning, Quinlan's ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations. [10]Neural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012. Early examples are Rosenblatt's perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989. [14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn't work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks. ""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.

48610,18319,"Please explain what is ""Symbolic AI""","Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic-based methods to solve problems. It is also sometimes referred to as ""classical AI"" or ""good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI). ""In symbolic AI, problems are solved by manipulating symbols according to a set of rules. The symbols represent concepts or entities in the problem domain, and the rules represent the relationships between those concepts or entities. For example, a symbolic AI system might be designed to solve a puzzle by representing the different pieces of the puzzle as symbols and using rules to manipulate those symbols and find a solution.Symbolic AI systems are often based on first-order logic, which allows them to represent and reason about the properties of objects and the relationships between them. This makes them well-suited for tasks that require logical reasoning and problem-solving, such as natural language processing, planning, and theorem proving.However, symbolic AI systems have some limitations. They can be difficult to design and implement, and they may require a large amount of human-generated knowledge to be encoded into the system. In addition, they can be inflexible and may not be able to handle uncertainty or handle tasks that require a lot of data or sensory input.Today, symbolic AI is often used in combination with other AI techniques, such as machine learning and neural networks, in order to improve their performance and overcome some of their limitations.",1,wikipedia_csai

The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of artificial intelligence, it also has connections with theoretical computer science and philosophy.The most developed subareas of automated reasoning are automated theorem proving (and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of interactive theorem proving) and automated proof checking (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions). [citation needed] Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by analogy using induction and abduction.Other important topics include reasoning under uncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty field is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and consistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John Pollock's OSCAR system is an example of an automated argumentation system that is more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.Tools and techniques of automated reasoning include the classical logics and calculi, fuzzy logic, Bayesian inference, reasoning with maximal entropy and many less formal ad hoc techniques.",0,wikipedia_csai

The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: ""What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers? "".In order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible ""reasonable"" model of computation (see Church–Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory.

The field was originally established by the works of Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley, in the 1920s, and Claude Shannon in the 1940s. : vii  The field is at the intersection of probability theory, statistics, computer science, statistical mechanics, information engineering, and electrical engineering.A key measure in information theory is entropy. Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy. Important sub-fields of information theory include source coding, algorithmic complexity theory, algorithmic information theory and information-theoretic security.Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding/data compression (e.g. for ZIP files), and channel coding/error detection and correction (e.g. for DSL). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the Internet. The theory has also found applications in other areas, including statistical inference, cryptography, neurobiology, perception, linguistics, the evolution and function of molecular codes (bioinformatics), thermal physics, molecular dynamics, quantum computing, black holes, information retrieval, intelligence gathering, plagiarism detection,[10] pattern recognition, anomaly detection[11] and even art creation.",0,wikipedia_csai

It was developed by Claude Shannon in the 1940s as a way to formalize the concept of information and to quantify the amount of information that can be transmitted over a given channel.The central idea of information theory is that information can be quantified as a measure of the uncertainty of an event. For example, if you know that a coin is fair, then the outcome of a coin flip is equally likely to be heads or tails, and the amount of information you receive from the outcome of the coin flip is low. On the other hand, if you don't know whether the coin is fair or not, then the outcome of the coin flip is more uncertain, and the amount of information you receive from the outcome is higher.In information theory, the concept of entropy is used to quantify the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. The more uncertainty or randomness there is, the higher the entropy. Information theory also introduces the concept of mutual information, which is a measure of the amount of information that one random variable contains about another.Information theory has applications in a wide range of fields, including computer science, engineering, and statistics.

It has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power. These activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field of application, and they have undergone substantial development over the past few decades.Pattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled ""training"" data. When no labeled data are available, other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and signal processing into consideration. It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.In machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes (for example, determine whether a given email is ""spam""). Pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.Pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform ""most likely"" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to pattern matching algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors.",0,wikipedia_csai

More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.Every academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. New ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages.For instance, the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics, but also in other subfields of economics. An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much (see risk management).What ontologies in both computer science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in computer science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence).Applied ontology is considered a successor to prior work in philosophy, however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles, the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes.

Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources.

The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.The study of the complexity of explicitly given algorithms is called analysis of algorithms, while the study of the complexity of problems is called computational complexity theory. Both areas are highly related, as the complexity of an algorithm is always an upper bound on the complexity of the problem solved by this algorithm. Moreover, for designing efficient algorithms, it is often fundamental to compare the complexity of a specific algorithm to the complexity of the problem to be solved. Also, in most cases, the only thing that is known about the complexity of a problem is that it is lower than the complexity of the most efficient known algorithms. Therefore, there is a large overlap between analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. As the amount of resources required to run an algorithm generally varies with the size of the input, the complexity is typically expressed as a function n → f(n), where n is the size of the input and f(n) is either the worst-case complexity (the maximum of the amount of resources that are needed over all inputs of size n) or the average-case complexity (the average of the amount of resources over all inputs of size n). Time complexity is generally expressed as the number of required elementary operations on an input of size n, where elementary operations are assumed to take a constant amount of time on a given computer and change only by a constant factor when run on a different computer.

An algorithm is considered to be efficient if it can solve a problem in a reasonable amount of time and space, given the size of the input. On the other hand, an algorithm that requires an unreasonable amount of time or space to solve a problem is considered to be inefficient.There are several different measures of computational complexity, including time complexity, space complexity, and overall complexity. Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time required to solve a problem using an algorithm, while space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory required to solve the problem. Overall complexity is a measure of both time and space complexity.Computational complexity theory is an important field in computer science because it helps to identify the limits of what can be computed efficiently and to design algorithms that are as efficient as possible. It also helps to understand the trade-offs between different algorithms and to choose the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem.",1,wikipedia_csai

This allows users to communicate with the device in a more natural and intuitive way, using language and syntax that is similar to how they would communicate with another person.NLUIs are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, and they are often used in applications where a more traditional interface would be too complex or confusing. Some examples of applications that might use an NLUI include voice-activated personal assistants, chatbots, and virtual assistants.NLUIs can be implemented using various technologies, such as natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, machine learning models, and rule-based systems. These technologies allow the NLUI to understand and interpret the user's input, and to provide a response or perform an action based on that input.Overall, NLUIs offer a more human-like and natural way of interacting with technology, and they can be an effective way to simplify complex tasks or make technology more accessible to a wider audience.",1,wikipedia_csai

For example, the sentences ""Pat loves Chris"" and ""Chris is loved by Pat"" mean roughly the same thing and use similar words.

48678,18378,"Please explain what is ""Deep structure""","In linguistics, the term ""deep structure"" refers to the underlying meaning and structure of a sentence or phrase, which is thought to be the source of the surface structure or the way that the sentence is actually expressed. This concept was developed by Noam Chomsky and his followers as part of their theory of transformational grammar, which proposes that the deep structure of a sentence is transformed into its surface structure through a series of rules.According to this theory, the deep structure of a sentence consists of the underlying syntactic and semantic relationships between the words and phrases in the sentence. It is thought to be the source of the various surface structures that a sentence can have, depending on the context in which it is used and the rules that are applied to transform it.For example, consider the following sentence: ""The cat sat on the mat."" This sentence has a simple deep structure that consists of a subject (""the cat""), a verb (""sat""), and an object (""the mat""). The surface structure of this sentence is the specific way that it is expressed, with the words arranged in a particular order and with specific inflections applied to the verb.Deep structure is an important concept in linguistics because it helps to explain how the meaning of a sentence is conveyed and how different surface structures can be derived from a single deep structure.

48679,18379,"Please explain what is ""Intractability (complexity)""","In theoretical computer science and mathematics, computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kinds of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.",0,wikipedia_csai

Some problems are easy to solve and can be completed quickly by a computer, while others are much more difficult and may take a long time or even be impossible to solve using current technology.Intractability can be a result of the size of the problem, the number of steps required to solve the problem, or the amount of resources (such as time or memory) needed to solve the problem. It can also be caused by the inherent complexity of the problem itself, such as when the problem requires a large amount of computation or when the problem is not well-defined.Some examples of intractable problems include the traveling salesman problem, the shortest path problem, and the knapsack problem. These problems are difficult to solve because they require a large amount of computation or because there are a large number of possible solutions that must be considered.Intractability is an important concept in computer science and can have significant implications for the design and implementation of algorithms and computer systems.

It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.Some speech recognition systems require ""training"" (also called ""enrollment"") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called ""speaker-independent"" systems. Systems that use training are called ""speaker dependent"".Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. ""call home""), call routing (e.g. ""I would like to make a collect call""), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations.

Since their inception, facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology, such as robotics. Because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of a human's physiological characteristics, facial recognition systems are categorized as biometrics. Although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition and fingerprint recognition, it is widely adopted due to its contactless process. Facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced human–computer interaction, video surveillance and automatic indexing of images.Facial recognition systems are employed throughout the world today by governments and private companies. Their effectiveness varies, and some systems have previously been scrapped because of their ineffectiveness. The use of facial recognition systems has also raised controversy, with claims that the systems violate citizens' privacy, commonly make incorrect identifications, encourage gender norms and racial profiling, and do not protect important biometric data. The appearance of synthetic media such as deepfakes has also raised concerns about its security. These claims have led to the ban of facial recognition systems in several cities in the United States. As a result of growing societal concerns, Meta announced that it plans to shut down Facebook facial recognition system, deleting the face scan data of more than one billion users.

For example, the rule of inference called modus ponens takes two premises, one in the form ""If p then q"" and another in the form ""p"", and returns the conclusion ""q"". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.Typically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary ω-rule.Popular rules of inference in propositional logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and contraposition.

For example, if you know that all mammals are warm-blooded, and you know that a particular animal is a mammal, you can deduce that the animal is warm-blooded. This is an example of a deductive inference rule called modus ponens.Inductive inference rules allow you to draw conclusions that are likely to be true based on given information.

[full citation needed]Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into three types of algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing. Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion. Binary, or half-interval, searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order. Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures by using numerical keys. Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.Algorithms are often evaluated by their computational complexity, or maximum theoretical run time.

Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting.One of the questions that arises in a decision tree algorithm is the optimal size of the final tree. A tree that is too large risks overfitting the training data and poorly generalizing to new samples. A small tree might not capture important structural information about the sample space. However, it is hard to tell when a tree algorithm should stop because it is impossible to tell if the addition of a single extra node will dramatically decrease error. This problem is known as the horizon effect. A common strategy is to grow the tree until each node contains a small number of instances then use pruning to remove nodes that do not provide additional information.Pruning should reduce the size of a learning tree without reducing predictive accuracy as measured by a cross-validation set.

It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found.For example, hill climbing can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. It is easy to find an initial solution that visits all the cities but will likely be very poor compared to the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with such a solution and makes small improvements to it, such as switching the order in which two cities are visited. Eventually, a much shorter route is likely to be obtained.Hill climbing finds optimal solutions for convex problems – for other problems it will find only local optima (solutions that cannot be improved upon by any neighboring configurations), which are not necessarily the best possible solution (the global optimum) out of all possible solutions (the search space). Examples of algorithms that solve convex problems by hill-climbing include the simplex algorithm for linear programming and binary search. : 253  To attempt to avoid getting stuck in local optima, one could use restarts (i.e. repeated local search), or more complex schemes based on iterations (like iterated local search), or on memory (like reactive search optimization and tabu search), or on memory-less stochastic modifications (like simulated annealing).The relative simplicity of the algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node. Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well. Hill climbing can often produce a better result than other algorithms when the amount of time available to perform a search is limited, such as with real-time systems, so long as a small number of increments typically converges on a good solution (the optimal solution or a close approximation). At the other extreme, bubble sort can be viewed as a hill climbing algorithm (every adjacent element exchange decreases the number of disordered element pairs), yet this approach is far from efficient for even modest N, as the number of exchanges required grows quadratically. Hill climbing is an anytime algorithm: it can return a valid solution even if it's interrupted at any time before it ends.",0,wikipedia_csai

The algorithm starts at a randomly chosen point on the function and then iteratively moves to a neighboring point that has a higher value, until it reaches a point where no neighboring point has a higher value. This point is then considered to be the local maximum or minimum of the function.The algorithm can be described as follows:Choose a starting point on the function.Evaluate the value of the function at the starting point.Check the neighboring points to see if any of them have a higher value than the current point. If so, move to the neighboring point with the highest value.Repeat step 3 until no neighboring point has a higher value than the current point.Hill climbing is a simple and effective algorithm, but it has some limitations. It can get stuck in local maxima or minima, which are points that are not the global maximum or minimum of the function but are still the highest or lowest point in their immediate vicinity. In addition, the algorithm does not guarantee that it will find the global maximum or minimum of the function, only the local maximum or minimum.",1,wikipedia_csai

This can be computationally expensive if the graph is large or the layers are deep. Beam search tries to balance the trade-off between completeness and efficiency by expanding a fixed number of nodes, known as the beam width, at each layer.For example, if the beam width is set to 3, the algorithm will only expand the 3 most promising nodes at each layer. This means that the search may not find the optimal solution, but it will be faster than a breadth-first search.Beam search is often used in natural language processing and machine translation to find the most likely sequence of words in a language model.

Domesticated animals are known as breeds, normally bred by a professional breeder, while domesticated plants are known as varieties, cultigens, cultivars, or breeds. Two purebred animals of different breeds produce a crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids. Flowers, vegetables and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals.In animal breeding, techniques such as inbreeding, linebreeding, and outcrossing are utilized. In plant breeding, similar methods are used. Charles Darwin discussed how selective breeding had been successful in producing change over time in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species. Its first chapter discusses selective breeding and domestication of such animals as pigeons, cats, cattle, and dogs. Darwin used artificial selection as a springboard to introduce and support the theory of natural selection.The deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has become very common in agriculture and experimental biology.Selective breeding can be unintentional, for example, resulting from the process of human cultivation; and it may also produce unintended – desirable or undesirable – results. For example, in some grains, an increase in seed size may have resulted from certain ploughing practices rather than from the intentional selection of larger seeds.

For example, humans have bred cattle for meat, milk, and leather; dogs for hunting, herding, and guarding; and crops for yield, taste, and disease resistance.Artificial selection can also be used in the laboratory setting to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In this process, scientists can use techniques such as gene editing to introduce specific traits into an organism's genome, or they can transfer genes from one organism to another using techniques such as genetic engineering.Overall, artificial selection is a powerful tool that has had a significant impact on the diversity of plants and animals that we see today, and it continues to be an important area of research and development in the field of biology.",1,wikipedia_csai

Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation.

The crossover operation involves swapping random parts of selected pairs (parents) to produce new and different offspring that become part of the new generation of programs.

Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used. Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.As an example, ant colony optimization  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony. Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions. Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment. The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions. One variation on this approach is the bees algorithm, which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the honey bee, another social insect.This algorithm is a member of the ant colony algorithms family, in swarm intelligence methods, and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations. Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 in his PhD thesis, the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants.

ACO algorithms use a similar process to find approximate solutions to optimization problems.In ACO, a set of artificial ants is used to search for good solutions to the problem. Each ant builds a solution by constructing a path through a graph, with the quality of the solution being determined by the cost of the path. The ants communicate with each other through pheromone trails, which are used to indicate the desirability of different paths.As the ants search for solutions, they leave pheromone trails on the paths they take. These trails serve as a kind of ""memory"" for the ants, allowing them to remember which paths are good and which are not. Over time, the pheromone trails on the most desirable paths become stronger, while the trails on less desirable paths fade away. This process allows the ants to adapt their search strategies as they learn more about the problem.ACO algorithms have been applied to a wide range of optimization problems, including scheduling, routing, and resource allocation.

Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called ""drones"" and one or more fertile females called ""queens"" (gynes). The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in moist tropical ecosystems and may exceed the combined biomass of wild birds and mammals. Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.Ant societies have division of labour, communication between individuals, and an ability to solve complex problems. These parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rites. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings.

First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as ""Socrates is a man"", one can have expressions in the form ""there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man"", where ""there exists"" is a quantifier, while x is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations; in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic.A theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse (over which the quantified variables range), finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold about them. Sometimes, ""theory"" is understood in a more formal sense as just a set of sentences in first-order logic.The adjective ""first-order"" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates or functions, or both, are permitted. : 56  In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.There are many deductive systems for first-order logic which are both sound (i.e., all provable statements are true in all models) and complete (i.e. all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the logical consequence relation is only semidecidable, much progress has been made in automated theorem proving in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several metalogical theorems that make it amenable to analysis in proof theory, such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem.First-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into axioms, and is studied in the foundations of mathematics.Peano arithmetic and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory are axiomatizations of number theory and set theory, respectively, into first-order logic.No first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe a structure with an infinite domain, such as the natural numbers or the real line. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, categorical axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as second-order logic.The foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by Gottlob Frege and Charles Sanders Peirce.

On the other hand, the existential quantifier ∃{\displaystyle \exists } in the formula ∃xP(x){\displaystyle \exists xP(x)} expresses that there exists something in the domain which satisfies that property. A formula where a quantifier takes widest scope is called a quantified formula. A quantified formula must contain a bound variable and a subformula specifying a property of the referent of that variable.The mostly commonly used quantifiers are ∀{\displaystyle \forall } and ∃{\displaystyle \exists }. These quantifiers are standardly defined as duals; in classical logic, they are interdefinable using negation. They can also be used to define more complex quantifiers, as in the formula ¬∃xP(x){\displaystyle eg \exists xP(x)} which expresses that nothing has the property P{\displaystyle P}. Other quantifiers are only definable within second order logic or higher order logics. Quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindström.In a first-order logic statement, quantifications in the same type (either universal quantifications or existential quantifications) can be exchanged without changing the meaning of the statement, while the exchange of quantifications in different types changes the meaning. As an example, the only difference in the definition of uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity is the order of quantifications.First order quantifiers approximate the meanings of some natural language quantifiers such as ""some"" and ""all"".

For example, the statement ""For all x, x is a number"" is a universal statement because it asserts that the property of being a number holds for every element in the domain of x. In symbolic logic, the universal quantifier is usually represented by the symbol ""∀"".An existential quantifier is a symbol or word that specifies that there exists at least one element in the domain of a logical statement that satisfies a particular condition. For example, the statement ""There exists an x such that x is a prime number"" is an existential statement because it asserts that there is at least one element in the domain of x that is a prime number. In symbolic logic, the existential quantifier is usually represented by the symbol ""∃"".Quantifiers play a crucial role in formal logic and are used to make more complex statements about the relationships between different elements in a logical domain.

For instance, in the first order formula P(a){\displaystyle P(a)}, the symbol P{\displaystyle P} is a predicate which applies to the individual constant a{\displaystyle a}. Similarly, in the formula R(a,b){\displaystyle R(a,b)}, R{\displaystyle R} is a predicate which applies to the individual constants a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}. In the semantics of logic, predicates are interpreted as relations. For instance, in a standard semantics for first-order logic, the formula R(a,b){\displaystyle R(a,b)} would be true on an interpretation if the entities denoted by a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} stand in the relation denoted by R{\displaystyle R}. Since predicates are non-logical symbols, they can denote different relations depending on the interpretation used to interpret them.

For example, ""x is greater than y"" is a predicate, because it is either true or false depending on the values of x and y. Predicates are often used to define the properties of a set or the relationship between different elements in a set.In formal logic, predicates are usually written using a capital letter followed by a sequence of variables. For example, ""P(x)"" is a predicate that takes a single variable x. ""Q(x,y)"" is a predicate that takes two variables, x and y. The values of the variables are often referred to as arguments of the predicate.Predicates can be combined using logical connectives such as ""and"", ""or"", and ""not"" to form more complex statements. For example, ""P(x) and Q(x,y)"" is a predicate that is true if both P(x) and Q(x,y) are true.Predicates are often used in logical systems such as first-order logic to express the relationships between different objects or concepts.

By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.The term fuzzy logic was introduced with the 1965 proposal of fuzzy set theory by Iranian Azerbaijani mathematician Lotfi Zadeh. Fuzzy logic had, however,  been studied since the 1920s, as infinite-valued logic—notably by Łukasiewicz and Tarski.Fuzzy logic is based on the observation that people make decisions based on imprecise and non-numerical information. Fuzzy models or sets are mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information (hence the term fuzzy). These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and using data and information that are vague and lack certainty.Fuzzy logic has been applied to many fields, from control theory to artificial intelligence.",0,wikipedia_csai

Fuzzy logic has been used in a wide range of applications, including artificial intelligence, control systems, and decision-making.In fuzzy logic, a statement can have a truth value that is a real number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents complete falsehood and 1 represents complete truth. This allows for more flexibility in representing uncertain or imprecise information. For example, the statement ""It is very cold outside"" might have a truth value of 0.9, while the statement ""It is slightly cold outside"" might have a truth value of 0.5.Fuzzy logic systems use fuzzy rules to make decisions based on imprecise or incomplete data. These rules are written in the form of IF-THEN statements, where the antecedent (IF part) is a fuzzy set and the consequent (THEN part) is a crisp value. For example, a fuzzy rule might be written as:IF temperature IS cold THEN heater ONIn this rule, ""temperature"" is a fuzzy set that represents the degree of coldness, and ""heater ON"" is a crisp value that represents the action to be taken. The system uses the rule to determine the appropriate action based on the degree of coldness.Fuzzy logic has been used in a variety of applications, including control systems, artificial intelligence, and decision-making.

48745,18438,"Please explain what is ""Kalman filter""","For statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, including statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, who was one of the primary developers of its theory.This digital filter is sometimes termed the Stratonovich–Kalman–Bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general, nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the Soviet mathematician Ruslan Stratonovich. In fact, some of the special case linear filter's equations appeared in  papers by Stratonovich that were published before summer 1960, when Kalman met with Stratonovich during a conference in Moscow.Kalman filtering has numerous technological applications. A common application is for guidance, navigation, and control of vehicles, particularly aircraft, spacecraft and ships positioned dynamically. Furthermore, Kalman filtering is a concept much applied in time series analysis used for topics such as signal processing and econometrics. Kalman filtering is also one of the main topics of robotic motion planning and control and can be used for trajectory optimization. [10] Kalman filtering also works for modeling the central nervous system's control of movement. Due to the time delay between issuing motor commands and receiving sensory feedback, the use of Kalman filters[11] provides a realistic model for making estimates of the current state of a motor system and issuing updated commands. [12]The algorithm works by a two-phase process. For the prediction phase, the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables, along with their uncertainties. Once the outcome of the next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some error, including random noise) is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight being given to estimates with greater certainty. The algorithm is recursive. It can operate in real time, using only the present input measurements and the state calculated previously and its uncertainty matrix; no additional past information is required.Optimality of Kalman filtering assumes that errors have a normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the words of Rudolf E. Kálmán: ""In summary, the following assumptions are made about random processes: Physical random phenomena may be thought of as due to primary random sources exciting dynamic systems. The primary sources are assumed to be independent gaussian random processes with zero mean; the dynamic systems will be linear. ""[13]  Though regardless of Gaussianity, if the process and measurement covariances are known, the Kalman filter is the best possible linear estimator in the minimum mean-square-error sense. [14]Extensions and generalizations of the method have also been developed, such as the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter which work on nonlinear systems. The basis is a hidden Markov model such that the state space of the latent variables is continuous and all latent and observed variables have Gaussian distributions. Kalman filtering has been used successfully in multi-sensor fusion,[15] and distributed sensor networks to develop distributed or consensus Kalman filtering. [16]",0,wikipedia_csai

It works by combining an initial estimate of the state of the system with additional information from noisy observations to produce a more accurate estimate.The Kalman filter involves two steps: prediction and correction. In the prediction step, the filter uses a process model to predict the state of the system at the next time step based on the current estimate and any additional control inputs. In the correction step, the filter updates the estimate based on new observations, using a measurement model to relate the observations to the state of the system.The Kalman filter can be used for both linear and nonlinear systems, and it is often used in applications where the system being modeled is uncertain or the observations are noisy.

It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.

MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains.At each time step, the process is in some state s{\displaystyle s}, and the decision maker may choose any action a{\displaystyle a} that is available in state s{\displaystyle s}. The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state s′{\displaystyle s'}, and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward Ra(s,s′){\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}.The probability that the process moves into its new state s′{\displaystyle s'} is influenced by the chosen action. Specifically, it is given by the state transition function Pa(s,s′){\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')}. Thus, the next state s′{\displaystyle s'} depends on the current state s{\displaystyle s} and the decision maker's action a{\displaystyle a}. But given s{\displaystyle s} and a{\displaystyle a}, it is conditionally independent of all previous states and actions; in other words, the state transitions of an MDP satisfy the Markov property.Markov decision processes are an extension of Markov chains; the difference is the addition of actions (allowing choice) and rewards (giving motivation). Conversely, if only one action exists for each state (e.g. ""wait"") and all rewards are the same (e.g. ""zero""), a Markov decision process reduces to a Markov chain.",0,wikipedia_csai

This assumption allows the algorithm to make predictions more quickly and efficiently, but it may not always be accurate.The Naive Bayes classifier is often used in natural language processing and spam filtering, as well as other applications where the features are independent of each other. It is a simple and effective algorithm that is easy to implement and can work well with large datasets.

48759,18450,"Please explain what is ""Hebbian learning""","Hebbian theory is a neuroscientific theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:The theory is often summarized as ""Cells that fire together wire together."" However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to ""take part in firing"" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.The theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning.",0,wikipedia_csai
48760,18450,"Please explain what is ""Hebbian learning""","Hebbian learning is a type of learning that occurs in the brain and is named after the Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb. It is based on the idea that neurons that fire together wire together, meaning that the connection between two neurons becomes stronger when they are active at the same time. This is believed to be one of the ways that the brain learns and adapts to new information.In Hebbian learning, the strength of the connection between two neurons is increased when they are activated simultaneously. This leads to the formation of new neural pathways, which can then be used to store and process information. Hebbian learning is thought to play a role in a variety of cognitive processes, including learning, memory, and decision making.Hebbian learning is different from other types of learning, such as classical conditioning or reinforcement learning, in that it does not rely on the reinforcement of specific behaviors or the association of stimuli with particular outcomes. Instead, it is based on the idea that the brain changes in response to experience and that these changes can be permanent.",1,wikipedia_csai
48761,18451,"Please explain what is ""Gradient descent""","In mathematics, gradient descent (also often called steepest descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.Gradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. Jacques Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907. Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.",0,wikipedia_csai
48762,18451,"Please explain what is ""Gradient descent""","Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients and biases) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function.In machine learning, we often want to find the parameters that minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. The cost function quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual output and the goal of the optimization is to find the values of the parameters that minimize this difference, or cost.The gradient descent algorithm works by starting with initial guesses for the parameters and then iteratively adjusting them to reduce the cost. At each step, the algorithm computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The gradient is a vector that indicates the direction of steepest descent. The algorithm then updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient, since this will reduce the cost. This process is repeated until the cost function is minimized or until a predefined number of iterations is reached.There are several variations of the gradient descent algorithm, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. The choice of which variant to use depends on the specific problem and the available computational resources.",1,wikipedia_csai

48764,18452,"Please explain what is ""Competitive learning""","Competitive learning is a type of learning rule used in artificial neural networks that involves training a network to classify inputs by adjusting the weights of the connections between the neurons in the network. In competitive learning, the neurons in the network compete with each other to classify the input. This is typically done by having each neuron in the network receive input from the previous layer, and then the neuron with the highest activation (i.e., the one that is most strongly activated by the input) wins the competition and is allowed to pass its activation to the next layer of the network. The weights of the connections between the neurons are adjusted in order to optimize the network's ability to classify the input.Competitive learning is often used in self-organizing maps, which are neural networks that are trained to project high-dimensional input data onto a lower-dimensional output space in a way that preserves the topological structure of the data. This allows the network to learn to cluster the data and classify it based on its topological relationships.Overall, competitive learning is a useful tool for training artificial neural networks to classify inputs, and it is often used in combination with other learning algorithms in order to improve the performance of the network.",1,wikipedia_csai

It consists of multiple layers of interconnected ""neurons,"" which process and transmit information. Each layer receives input from the previous layer, processes it, and passes it on to the next layer. The output of the final layer is the network's prediction or classification of the input data.The first layer of a feedforward neural network is called the input layer, and it consists of neurons that receive the input data. The middle layers are called hidden layers, and they process the input data using weights and biases. The final layer is called the output layer, and it produces the network's prediction or classification.Feedforward neural networks are called ""feedforward"" because the information flows through the network in only one direction, from the input layer to the output layer, without looping back. This is in contrast to other types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, which can process information in a loop.Feedforward neural networks are widely used in a variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

The input layer receives the input data, the hidden layers process the data, and the output layer produces the output.MLPs are used for a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, and function approximation. They are particularly well-suited for tasks that require complex decision boundaries, such as recognizing handwritten digits or classifying images.MLPs are trained using a variant of the backpropagation algorithm, which involves adjusting the weights of the connections between neurons in order to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output. The weights are adjusted iteratively, using a process called gradient descent, until the error is minimized.One of the key features of MLPs is that they are fully connected, meaning that every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. This allows them to model complex relationships between the input and output data.

AI is often used in mechanisms which are not immediately visible to the user, such as data mining and procedural-content generation.In general, game AI does not, as might be thought and sometimes is depicted to be the case, mean a realization of an artificial person corresponding to an NPC in the manner of the Turing test or an artificial general intelligence.",0,wikipedia_csai

Game AI can be used to make NPCs behave in a way that is more realistic or engaging for players. Some common applications of game AI include pathfinding (for characters to navigate through a game world), decision-making (for characters to make choices about their actions), and strategic planning (for characters to anticipate and respond to player actions).Game AI is an important part of many modern video games, as it helps to create immersive and engaging gameplay experiences.

48799,18481,"Please explain what is ""Computer Go""","Computer Go is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to creating a computer program that plays the traditional board game Go. The field is sharply divided into two eras. Before 2015, the programs of the era were weak. The best efforts of the 1980s and 1990s produced only AIs that could be defeated by beginners, and AIs of the early 2000s were intermediate level at best. Professionals could defeat these programs even given handicaps of 10+ stones in favor of the AI. Many of the algorithms such as alpha-beta minimax that performed well as AIs for checkers and chess fell apart on Go's 19x19 board, as there were too many branching possibilities to consider. Creation of a human professional quality program with the techniques and hardware of the time was out of reach. Some AI researchers speculated that the problem was unsolvable without creation of human-like AI.The application of Monte Carlo tree search to Go algorithms provided a notable improvement in the late 2000s decade, with programs finally able to achieve a low-dan level: that of an advanced amateur. High-dan amateurs and professionals could still exploit these programs' weaknesses and win consistently, but computer performance had advanced past the intermediate (single-digit kyu) level. The tantalizing unmet goal of defeating the best human players without a handicap, long thought unreachable, brought a burst of renewed interest. The key insight proved to be an application of machine learning and deep learning.

This means that the weaker player will place two stones on the board at predetermined positions before the stronger player makes the first move. The stronger player then plays as usual, but must consider the additional stones placed on the board as part of the weaker player's strategy.Handicaps are used in Go to make the game more competitive and enjoyable for both players, as it allows players of different skill levels to play against each other without one player having a significant advantage.",1,wikipedia_csai

Released in September 1977, it popularized microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on swappable ROM cartridges, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge—initially Combat and later Pac-Man.Atari was successful at creating arcade video games, but their development cost and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home system. The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technology in late 1975 made this feasible. The console was prototyped as codename Stella by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering. Lacking funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976.The Atari VCS launched in 1977 with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 KB cartridges. The system's first killer app was the home conversion of Taito's arcade game Space Invaders in 1980. The VCS became widely successful, leading to the founding of Activision and other third-party game developers and to competition from console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco. By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983–84, games for the 2600 were using more than four times the storage size of the launch games with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as Activision's Pitfall!.In 1982, the Atari 2600 was the dominant game system in North America. Amid competition from both new consoles and game developers, a number of poor decisions from Atari management affected the company and the industry as a whole. The most public was an extreme investment into licensed games for the 2600, including Pac-Man and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Pac-Man became the system's biggest selling game, but the conversion's poor quality eroded consumer confidence in the console. E.T. was rushed to market for the holiday shopping season and was critically panned and a commercial failure. Both games, and a glut of third-party shovelware, were factors in ending Atari's relevance in the console market. Atari's downfall reverberated through the industry resulting in the video game crash of 1983.Warner sold Atari's home division to former Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel in 1984. In 1986, the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backward-compatible Atari 7800, but it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry with its 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.The test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: ""I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'"" Because ""thinking"" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to ""replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."" Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the ""imitation game"", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players. Turing's new question is: ""Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?"" This question, Turing believed, was one that could actually be answered. In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that ""machines can think"".Since Turing introduced his test, it has been both highly influential and widely criticised, and has become an important concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.

It is named after Alan Turing, a British mathematician and computer scientist who proposed the test in 1950.The test is conducted by having a human judge engage in natural language conversations with another human and with a machine, and then deciding which of the two they are communicating with. If the judge cannot reliably tell which is the machine and which is the human, the machine is said to have passed the Turing Test.The Turing Test is often used as a benchmark for determining whether a machine exhibits artificial intelligence, although it is not a perfect measure. Some critics argue that the test is too limited in scope, as it only measures a machine's ability to mimic human conversation and does not take into account other forms of intelligent behavior. Others argue that the test is too subjective, as it relies on the judgments of individual human judges. Despite these criticisms, the Turing Test remains a widely recognized and influential concept in the field of artificial intelligence.",1,wikipedia_csai

For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect ""systematic and unfair"" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (2021).As algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.Algorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis.

It can occur when an algorithm is trained on biased data or when the algorithm itself is designed in a biased way. Algorithmic bias can have serious consequences for individuals and society, as it can perpetuate and amplify existing biases and inequalities.For example, if an algorithm is trained to predict who is likely to default on a loan, and the training data is biased because it disproportionately includes data on people from certain racial or socioeconomic groups who are more likely to default, the algorithm may be biased against those groups. This could result in people from those groups being unfairly denied loans or being offered less favorable terms. Similarly, if an algorithm is designed to screen job applicants and is biased against certain groups, it could result in those groups being unfairly excluded from job opportunities.It is important to recognize and address algorithmic bias in order to promote fairness and avoid negative consequences for individuals and society. This can involve designing algorithms in an unbiased way, using diverse and representative training data, and implementing safeguards to prevent and mitigate bias in automated decision-making systems.",1,wikipedia_csai

Sometimes called ""the father of modern linguistics"",[c] Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He is a Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and an Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is the author of more than 150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.Born to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his anti-war essay ""The Responsibility of Intellectuals"". Becoming associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's list of political opponents. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent, and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of unconditional freedom of speech, including that of Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from active teaching at MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.One of the most cited scholars alive,[d] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, contemporary state capitalism, U.S. involvement and Israel's role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media.

48829,18500,"Please explain what is ""Explainable AI""","Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the ""black box"" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. XAI is relevant even if there is no legal right or regulatory requirement. For example, XAI can improve the user experience of a product or service by helping end users trust that the AI is making good decisions. This way the aim of XAI is to explain what has been done, what is done right now, what will be done next and unveil the information the actions are based on. These characteristics make it possible (i) to confirm existing knowledge (ii) to challenge existing knowledge and (iii) to generate new assumptions.The algorithms used in AI can be differentiated into white-box and black-box machine learning (ML) algorithms. White-box models are ML models that provide results that are understandable for experts in the domain. Black-box models, on the other hand, are extremely hard to explain and can hardly be understood even by domain experts. [10] XAI algorithms are considered to follow the three principles of transparency, interpretability and explainability. Transparency is given “if the processes that extract model parameters from training data and generate labels from testing data can be described and motivated by the approach designer”. [11] Interpretability describes the possibility of comprehending the ML model and presenting the underlying basis for decision-making in a way that is understandable to humans. [12][13][14] Explainability is a concept that is recognized as important, but a joint definition is not yet available. [11] It is suggested that explainability in ML can be considered as “the collection of features of the interpretable domain, that have contributed for a given example to produce a decision (e.g., classification or regression)”. [15] If algorithms meet these requirements, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts. [16]Sometimes it is also possible to achieve a result with high accuracy with a white-box ML algorithm that is interpretable in itself. [17] This is especially important in domains like medicine, defense, finance and law, where it is crucial to understand the decisions and build up trust in the algorithms. Many researchers argue that, at least for supervised machine learning, the way forward is symbolic regression, where the algorithm searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset. [18][19][20]AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command ""maximize accuracy of assessing how positive film reviews are in the test dataset"". The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as ""reviews containing the word 'horrible' are likely to be negative"". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as ""reviews containing 'Daniel Day-Lewis' are usually positive""; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the train set, or if people consider the rule to be ""cheating"" or ""unfair"". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set. [21]",0,wikipedia_csai

In John Searle's terms it “would be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds”. Weak artificial intelligence focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems. As opposed to strong AI, which uses technology to be able to think and learn on its own. Computers are able to use methods such as algorithms and prior knowledge to develop their own ways of thinking like human beings do. Strong artificial intelligence systems are learning how to run independently of the programmers who programmed them. Weak AI is not able to have a mind of its own, and can only imitate physical behaviors that it can observe. It is contrasted with Strong AI, which is defined variously as: Scholars like Antonio Lieto have argued that the current research on both AI and cognitive modelling are perfectly aligned with the weak-AI hypothesis (that should not be confused with the ""general"" vs ""narrow"" AI distinction) and that the popular assumption that cognitively inspired AI systems espouse the strong AI hypothesis is ill-posed and problematic since ""artificial models of brain and mind can be used to understand mental phenomena without pretending that that they are the real phenomena that they are modelling""  (p. 85) (as, on the other hand, implied by the strong AI assumption).AI can be classified as being “… limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category.”  Narrow means the robot or computer is strictly limited to only being able to solve one problem at a time. Strong AI is conversely the opposite. Strong AI is as close to the human brain or mind as possible. This is all believed to be the case by philosopher John Searle. This idea of strong AI is also controversial, and Searle believes that the Turing test (created by Alan Turing during WW2, originally called the Imitation Game, used to test if a machine is as intelligent as a human) is not accurate or appropriate for testing strong AI.

The mind–body problem is a paradigmatic issue in philosophy of mind, although a number of other issues are addressed, such as the hard problem of consciousness and the nature of particular mental states. Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness and its neural correlates, the ontology of the mind, the nature of cognition and of thought, and the relationship of the mind to the body.Dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind–body problem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly.Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive physicalist or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body. [15] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, especially in the fields of sociobiology, computer science (specifically, artificial intelligence), evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences. [16][17][18][19] Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states. [20][21][22] Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the mind is not a separate substance, mental properties supervene on physical properties, or that the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science. [23][24] Continued neuroscientific progress has helped to clarify some of these issues; however, they are far from being resolved. Modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms. [25][26]However, a number of issues have  been recognized with non-reductive physicalism. First, it is irreconcilable with self-identity over time. Secondly, intentional states of consciousness do not make sense on non-reductive physicalism. Thirdly, free will is impossible to reconcile with either reductive or non-reductive physicalism.

48837,18507,"Please explain what is ""Subjective experience""","In philosophy of mind, qualia (/ˈkwɑːliə/ or /ˈkweɪliə/; singular form: quale) are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective quālis (Latin pronunciation: [ˈkʷaːlɪs]) meaning ""of what sort"" or ""of what kind"" in a specific instance, such as ""what it is like to taste a specific apple — this particular apple now"".Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, as well as the redness of an evening sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to propositional attitudes, where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what it is directly like to be experiencing.Philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett once suggested that qualia was ""an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us"".Much of the debate over their importance hinges on the definition of the term, and various philosophers emphasize or deny the existence of certain features of qualia. Consequently, the nature and existence of qualia under various definitions remain controversial. While some philosophers of mind like Daniel Dennett argue that qualia do not exist and are incompatible with neuroscience and naturalism, some neuroscientists and neurologists like Gerald Edelman, Antonio Damasio, Vilayanur Ramachandran, Giulio Tononi, Christof Koch and Rodolfo Llinás state that qualia exist and that the desire to eliminate them is based on an erroneous interpretation on the part of some philosophers regarding what constitutes science.

48839,18508,"Please explain what is ""Mind-body problem""","The mind–body problem is a philosophical debate concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind, and the brain as part of the physical body. The debate goes beyond addressing the mere question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically. Interactionism arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.The problem was popularized by René Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism, and by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, in Avicennian philosophy, and in earlier Asian traditions. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one unifying reality as in neutral or substance or essence, in terms of which everything can be explained.Each of these categories contains numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are substance dualism, which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and property dualism, which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are physicalism, which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; idealism, which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely a representation of mental processes; and neutral monism, which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. Psychophysical parallelism is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).Several philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The historical materialism of Karl Marx and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment. An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French structuralism, and is a position that generally characterized post-war Continental philosophy.The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension (if there is such a thing) has been raised as a criticism of dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body. [10] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly in the fields of sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences. [11][12][13][14]An ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model, described in the Buddhist teachings, explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena. [15] Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual's mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.

This is known as the dualist view. Dualists believe that the mind and the body are separate entities that interact with each other, but are not identical.Another way to approach the mind-body problem is to consider the mind and the body as two different aspects of the same thing.

In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem. [10] In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth. [11]In philosophy of mathematics, Putnam and W. V. O. Quine developed the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities,[12] later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but ""quasi-empirical"". [13] In epistemology, Putnam is known for his critique of the well-known ""brain in a vat"" thought experiment. This thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, but Putnam challenges its coherence. [14] In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called ""internal realism"",[15] which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are. [16]In his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to ""renew philosophy"" from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns. [17] He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [18]",0,wikipedia_csai

He began teaching at UC Berkeley in 1959, and was Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley until 2019.As an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Searle was secretary of ""Students against Joseph McCarthy"". He received all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil, from the University of Oxford, where he held his first faculty positions. Later, at UC Berkeley, he became the first tenured professor to join the 1964–1965 Free Speech Movement. In the late 1980s, Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley's 1980 rent stabilization ordinance. Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court's ""Searle Decision"" of 1990, Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994.In 2000, Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind & Brain Prize. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2010. Searle's early work on speech acts, influenced by J.L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein, helped establish his reputation. His notable concepts include the ""Chinese room"" argument against ""strong"" artificial intelligence.In June 2019, Searle's status as professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, was revoked for his repeated violations of the university's sexual harassment policies.",0,wikipedia_csai

He has taught at the University of California, Berkeley for much of his career and is currently the Slusser Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at that institution.Searle's work has been influential in the field of philosophy, particularly in the areas of language, mind, and consciousness. He has written extensively on the nature of intentionality, the structure of language, and the relationship between language and thought. In his famous Chinese room argument, he argued that it is impossible for a machine to have genuine understanding or consciousness, as it can only manipulate symbols and has no understanding of their meaning.Searle has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Jean Nicod Prize, the Erasmus Prize, and the National Humanities Medal.

The argument was presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, ""Minds, Brains, and Programs"", published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in 1980. Similar arguments were presented by Gottfried Leibniz (1714),  Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle's version has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of Searle's argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.The argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism, which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols, and that simulation of a given mental state is sufficient for its presence. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls strong AI: ""The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds. ""[b]Although it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of mainstream AI research because it does not show a limit in the amount of ""intelligent"" behavior a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.",0,wikipedia_csai

This means that a strong AI system would be able to understand and learn about the world in the same way that a human does, and would be able to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and learn from experience, just like a human.The strong AI hypothesis is often contrasted with the weak AI hypothesis, which states that AI systems can only be designed to perform specific tasks, and cannot exhibit general intelligence or understand the world in the same way that a human does. While weak AI systems may be able to perform specific tasks very well, they are not capable of adapting to new situations or learning in the same way that a human can.The strong AI hypothesis has been a subject of much discussion and debate in the field of artificial intelligence and philosophy, and there are differing opinions on whether it is possible to create a strong AI system. Some people believe that it is only a matter of time before strong AI becomes a reality, while others argue that it may never be possible to create a machine that is truly intelligent in the same way that a human is.",1,wikipedia_csai
48847,18513,"Please explain what is ""Animal rights""","Animal rights is the philosophy according to which many or all sentient animals have moral worth that is independent of their utility for humans, and that their most basic interests—such as avoiding suffering—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings. Broadly speaking, and particularly in popular discourse, the term ""animal rights"" is often used synonymously with ""animal protection"" or ""animal liberation"". More narrowly, ""animal rights"" refers to the idea that many animals have fundamental rights to be treated with respect as individuals—rights to life, liberty, and freedom from torture that may not be overridden by considerations of aggregate welfare.Many advocates for animal rights oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone. This idea, known as speciesism, is considered by them to be a prejudice as irrational as any other. They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, entertainment, or beasts of burden because their status as a different species from humans should not give them different rights from humans. Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as Jainism, Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto and Animism also espouse some forms of animal rights.In parallel to the debate about moral rights, law schools in North America now often teach animal law, and several legal scholars, such as Steven M. Wise and Gary L. Francione, support the extension of basic legal rights and personhood to non-human animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are hominids. Some animal-rights academics support this because it would break through the species barrier, but others oppose it because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on sentience alone. As of November 2019[update], 29 countries had enacted bans on hominoid experimentation; Argentina has granted a captive orangutan basic human rights since 2014.Outside the order of primates, animal-rights discussions most often address the status of mammals (compare charismatic megafauna). Other animals (considered less sentient) have gained less attention; insects relatively little[10](outside Jainism), and animal-like bacteria (despite their overwhelming numbers) hardly any. [11] The vast majority of animals have no legally recognised rights. [12]Critics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher Roger Scruton (1944–2020), who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights. [13] Another argument, associated with the utilitarian tradition, maintains that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering;[14] animals may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as ""necessary"" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests can vary considerably. [15] Certain forms of animal-rights activism, such as the destruction of fur farms and of animal laboratories by the Animal Liberation Front, have attracted criticism, including from within the animal-rights movement itself,[16] and have prompted reaction from the U.S. Congress with the enactment of laws, including the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, allowing the prosecution of this sort of activity as terrorism.

Animal rights advocates believe that animals have the right to live their lives free from human interference and exploitation, and that they should be allowed to live in a manner that is natural and appropriate for their species.

48849,18514,"Please explain what is ""Intelligence explosion""","The technological singularity—or simply the singularity—is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization. According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I.J. Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.The first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.The concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil's 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.Some scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. [10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.Prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.

Some proponents of the intelligence explosion hypothesis argue that such an event could lead to a significant change in the future course of human history, potentially resulting in unprecedented advances in science and technology, or even existential risks to humanity if the AI is not aligned with human values.

In 2019, its average global print circulation was over 909,476; this, combined with its digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. Across its social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016. The newspaper has a prominent focus on data journalism and interpretive analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.Founded in 1843, The Economist was first circulated by Scottish economist James Wilson to muster support for abolishing the British Corn Laws (1815–1846), a system of import tariffs. Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into political economy and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its fire engine red nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with no byline, in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. It is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, 1843, and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.The editorial stance of The Economist primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably economic liberalism. It has supported radical centrism as the concept became established in the late 20th century, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions economic liberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little reporting bias, and as exercising rigorous fact-checking and strict copyediting. Its extensive use of word play, high subscription prices, and depth of coverage has linked the paper with a high-income and educated readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations.

It is often used in security systems to verify the identity of a person before granting them access to a certain area or system.There are two main types of speaker recognition: speaker identification and speaker verification. Speaker identification is used to determine the identity of a speaker from a group of known speakers. This can be useful in situations where there is a need to identify an unknown speaker, such as in a criminal investigation. Speaker verification, on the other hand, is used to verify the identity of a speaker by comparing their voice to a known sample. This is often used in security systems to ensure that only authorized individuals can gain access to certain areas or systems.Speaker recognition systems work by analyzing the unique characteristics of a person's voice, such as pitch, frequency, and the shape of the vocal tract. These characteristics are used to create a ""voiceprint,"" which is a unique identifier for a person's voice. The system compares the voiceprint of the speaker to a database of known voiceprints to determine their identity.There are several factors that can affect the accuracy of speaker recognition systems, including the quality of the audio, the degree of variation in the speaker's voice over time, and the presence of background noise.

Examples are assigning a given email to the ""spam"" or ""non-spam"" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc. ).Often, the individual observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known variously as explanatory variables or features. These properties may variously be categorical (e.g. ""A"", ""B"", ""AB"" or ""O"", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. ""large"", ""medium"" or ""small""), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure).

In statistics, where classification is often done with logistic regression or a similar procedure, the properties of observations are termed explanatory variables (or independent variables, regressors, etc. ), and the categories to be predicted are known as outcomes, which are considered to be possible values of the dependent variable. In machine learning, the observations are often known as instances, the explanatory variables are termed features (grouped into a feature vector), and the possible categories to be predicted are classes.

48865,18527,"Please explain what is ""Training data""","In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.The model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.Finally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term ""validation set"" is sometimes used instead of ""test set"" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).Deciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available.",0,wikipedia_csai

For example, in a machine learning model for image classification, the input features might be the pixels of an image, and the output label might be the class to which the image belongs (such as ""cat,"" ""dog,"" ""car,"" etc. ).The machine learning model uses these labeled examples to learn the patterns in the data that are associated with each output label. Once the model has been trained, it can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen examples by applying the patterns it learned during training to the new data.Training data is a crucial part of the machine learning process, as the quality and quantity of the training data will directly impact the accuracy and performance of the resulting machine learning model.",1,wikipedia_csai
48867,18528,"Please explain what is ""Statistical classifier""","In statistics, classification is the problem of identifying which of a set of categories (sub-populations) an observation (or observations) belongs to. Examples are assigning a given email to the ""spam"" or ""non-spam"" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc. ).Often, the individual observations are analyzed into a set of quantifiable properties, known variously as explanatory variables or features. These properties may variously be categorical (e.g. ""A"", ""B"", ""AB"" or ""O"", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. ""large"", ""medium"" or ""small""), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure). Other classifiers work by comparing observations to previous observations by means of a similarity or distance function.An algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete implementation, is known as a classifier. The term ""classifier"" sometimes also refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm, that maps input data to a category.Terminology across fields is quite varied. In statistics, where classification is often done with logistic regression or a similar procedure, the properties of observations are termed explanatory variables (or independent variables, regressors, etc. ), and the categories to be predicted are known as outcomes, which are considered to be possible values of the dependent variable. In machine learning, the observations are often known as instances, the explanatory variables are termed features (grouped into a feature vector), and the possible categories to be predicted are classes. Other fields may use different terminology: e.g. in community ecology, the term ""classification"" normally refers to cluster analysis.",0,wikipedia_csai

These classifiers work by finding patterns in the training data and using these patterns to make predictions about the class labels of new data.For example, a classifier might be trained to recognize whether a given email is spam or not spam. To train the classifier, it would be fed a dataset of emails that have been labeled as spam or not spam. The classifier would then learn the patterns that distinguish spam emails from non-spam emails.

Credit ratings are typically assigned by credit rating agencies, which are independent companies that evaluate the credit risk of borrowers.Credit ratings are important because they help lenders, investors, and others assess the risk associated with lending money or investing in a particular borrower. A higher credit rating typically indicates a lower risk of default, meaning that the borrower is more likely to be able to pay back their debt on time. A lower credit rating, on the other hand, indicates a higher risk of default, meaning that the borrower may be less likely to pay back their debt on time.Credit ratings are typically expressed as a letter or series of letters, with ""AAA"" being the highest rating and ""D"" being the lowest. The specific rating system used may vary depending on the credit rating agency and the type of borrower being rated.It's worth noting that credit ratings are not static and can change over time.

[17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world. [19]Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford,  where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him. [20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle. [22]Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. [23][24]Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an ""additional dialogue"" credit.Cameron stated he devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, Piranha II: The Spawning (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to Conan the Destroyer (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Aliens (1986). The film's special effects, which included miniatures and stop-motion animation, were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.Defying low pre-release expectations, The Terminator topped the United States box office for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron's film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger's status as a leading man. The film's success led to a franchise consisting of several sequels, a television series, comic books, novels and video games.

It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 and it won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. It is the first installment of the Dune saga. In 2003, it was described as the world's best-selling science fiction novel.Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or ""spice"", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to a mostly negative response from critics and failed at the box office. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). A second film adaptation directed by Denis Villeneuve was released on October 21, 2021, to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $401 million worldwide. It also went on to win six Academy Awards. Villeneuve's film was essentially the first half of the original novel, and a sequel, which will cover the remaining story, has begun production and is set for release in 2023.

The film was produced by Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg, and Bonnie Curtis. It stars Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson, and William Hurt. Set in a futuristic post-climate change society, A.I. tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love.Development of A.I. originally began after producer/director Stanley Kubrick acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in development hell for years, partly because Kubrick felt that computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick died in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay and dedicated the film to Kubrick.A.I. Artificial Intelligence was released on June 29, 2001, in North America by Warner Bros.

As explained by Jan Melissen in The New Public Diplomacy: Soft Power in International Relations, cyber-diplomacy “links the impact of innovations in communication and information technology to diplomacy.” Cyber-diplomacy is also known as or is part of public diplomacy 2.0, EDiplomacy, and virtual diplomacy. Cyber-diplomacy has as its underpinnings that, “it recognizes that new communication technologies offer new opportunities to interact with a wider public by adopting a network approach and making the most of an increasingly multicentric global, interdependent system.” U.S. cyber-diplomacy is led by the United States Department of State and is a new tool in fulfilling the U.S. public diplomacy mission. As stated by Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, the mission of American public diplomacy “is to support the achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests, and enhance national security by informing and influencing foreign publics and by expanding and strengthening the relationship between the people and government of the United States and citizens of the rest of the world.” Even though the United States had engaged in cyber-diplomacy under President George W. Bush in 2006, the United States officially launched its cyber-diplomacy campaign in 2009. The development of cyber-diplomacy by the United States is a response to the shifts in international relations by extending the reach of U.S. diplomacy beyond government-to-government communications. The U.S. is adapting its statecraft by reshaping its diplomatic agendas to meet old challenges in new ways and by utilizing America's innovation. Cyber-Diplomacy as identified by the United States Department of State, “encompasses a wide range of U.S. interests in cyberspace.

Proactive cyber defence can be understood as options between offensive and defensive measures. It includes interdicting, disrupting or deterring an attack or a threat's preparation to attack, either pre-emptively or in self-defence. Common methods include cyber deception, attribution, threat hunting and adversarial pursuit. The mission of the pre-emptive and proactive operations is to conduct aggressive interception and disruption activities against an adversary using: psychological operations, managed information dissemination, precision targeting, information warfare operations, computer network exploitation, and other active threat reduction measures. The proactive defense strategy is meant to improve information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents and to provide strike options as well as to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battlespace. Proactive cyber defence can be a measure for detecting and obtaining information before a cyber attack, or it can also be impending cyber operation and be determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber counter-operation. The offensive capacity includes the manipulation and/or disruption of networks and systems with the purpose of limiting or eliminating the adversary's operational capability. This capability can be required to guarantee one's freedom of action in the cyber domain. Cyber-attacks can be launched to repel an attack (active defence) or to support the operational action. Proactive cyber defence differs from active defence, meaning that it is pre-emptive (not waiting for an attack to occur).

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the party's nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party; Clinton won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College vote, thereby losing the election to Donald Trump.Raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Rodham graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, Clinton co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. The National Law Journal twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As the first lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative—the Clinton health care plan—failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the Foster Care Independence Act. Clinton advocated for gender equality at the 1995 UN conference on women. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York and became the first First lady to simultaneously hold elected office, and then the first former First lady to serve in the Senate. She was re-elected in 2006 and chaired the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee from 2003 to 2007.

In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State in the first term of the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton established the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya but was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational JCPOA nuclear agreement in 2015. Her use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the email controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election.Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016, winning the Democratic nomination, and ran in the general election with Virginia senator Tim Kaine as her running mate.

It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Providing health care services means ""the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes"". Factors to consider in terms of health care access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the possibility to take paid time off work to use such services), sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, low income). Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).Health systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce, reliable information on which to base decisions and policies, and well-maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies.An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy, development, and industrialization.

48925,18571,"Please explain what is ""Drug design""","Drug design, often referred to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals including peptides and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.The phrase ""drug design"" is to some extent a misnomer. A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug. Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to select compounds with more favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicological profiles.",0,wikipedia_csai

Analogously, a classifier based on a generative model is a generative classifier, while a classifier based on a discriminative model is a discriminative classifier, though this term also refers to classifiers that are not based on a model.Standard examples of each, all of which are linear classifiers, are:In application to classification, one wishes to go from an observation x to a label y (or probability distribution on labels). One can compute this directly, without using a probability distribution (distribution-free classifier); one can estimate the probability of a label given an observation, P(Y|X=x){\displaystyle P(Y|X=x)} (discriminative model), and base classification on that; or one can estimate the joint distribution P(X,Y){\displaystyle P(X,Y)} (generative model), from that compute the conditional probability P(Y|X=x){\displaystyle P(Y|X=x)}, and then base classification on that.

It is also classified as a Markov random field.Boltzmann machines are theoretically intriguing because of the locality and Hebbian nature of their training algorithm (being trained by Hebb's rule), and because of their parallelism and the resemblance of their dynamics to simple physical processes. Boltzmann machines with unconstrained connectivity have not been proven useful for practical problems in machine learning or inference, but if the connectivity is properly constrained, the learning can be made efficient enough to be useful for practical problems.They are named after the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics, which is used in their sampling function. They were heavily popularized and promoted by Geoffrey Hinton, Terry Sejnowski and Yann LeCun in cognitive sciences communities and in machine learning.

This is often referred to as a ""two by three matrix"", a ""2×3-matrix"", or a matrix of dimension 2×3.Without further specifications, matrices represent linear maps, and allow explicit computations in linear algebra. Therefore, the study of matrices is a large part of linear algebra, and most properties and operations of abstract linear algebra can be expressed in terms of matrices. For example, matrix multiplication represents composition of linear maps.Not all matrices are related to linear algebra. This is, in particular, the case in graph theory, of incidence matrices, and adjacency matrices. This article focuses on matrices related to linear algebra, and, unless otherwise specified, all matrices represent linear maps or may be viewed as such.Square matrices, matrices with the same number of rows and columns, play a major role in matrix theory. Square matrices of a given dimension form a noncommutative ring, which is one of the most common examples of a noncommutative ring. The determinant of a square matrix is a number associated to the matrix, which is fundamental for the study of a square matrix; for example, a square matrix is invertible if and only if it has a nonzero determinant, and the eigenvalues of a square matrix are the roots of a polynomial determinant.In geometry, matrices are widely used for specifying and representing geometric transformations (for example rotations) and coordinate changes.

This heuristic does not intend to find the best solution, but it terminates in a reasonable number of steps; finding an optimal solution to such a complex problem typically requires unreasonably many steps.

Your goal is to complete as many tasks as possible within the given deadline. A greedy algorithm would approach this problem by always selecting the task that can be completed in the shortest amount of time first.

Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes. The first quantifies the approximation capabilities of neural networks with an arbitrary number of artificial neurons (""arbitrary width"" case) and the second focuses on the case with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons (""arbitrary depth"" case). In addition to these two classes, there are also universal approximation theorems for neural networks with bounded number of hidden layers and a limited number of neurons in each layer (""bounded depth and bounded width"" case).Universal approximation theorems imply that neural networks can represent a wide variety of interesting functions when given appropriate weights.

The theorem was first proved by George Cybenko in 1989, although similar results were proven earlier by Kolmogorov, Arbib, and others.The theorem states that, given any continuous function f(x) defined on a compact subset D of R^n, and given any positive real number ε, there exists a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer and a finite number of neurons, such that the network can approximate f(x) to within ε on the subset D. The number of neurons required in the hidden layer depends on the complexity of the function f(x) and the desired level of approximation ε.The universal approximation theorem is significant because it shows that feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer have the potential to approximate a wide range of functions, and can therefore be used for a wide range of tasks.

This means that there are no abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities. More precisely, a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its value can be assured by restricting to sufficiently small changes of its argument. A discontinuous function is a function that is not continuous. Up until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity, and considered only continuous functions. The epsilon–delta definition of a limit was introduced to formalize the definition of continuity.Continuity is one of the core concepts of calculus and mathematical analysis, where arguments and values of functions are real and complex numbers. The concept has been generalized to functions between metric spaces and between topological spaces. The latter are the most general continuous functions, and their definition is the basis of topology.A stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity. In order theory, especially in domain theory, a related concept of continuity is Scott continuity.As an example, the function H(t) denoting the height of a growing flower at time t would be considered continuous. In contrast, the function M(t) denoting the amount of money in a bank account at time t would be considered discontinuous, since it ""jumps"" at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn.",0,wikipedia_csai

Firstly, the function must be defined for all values in its domain. Secondly, the function must have a finite limit at every point in its domain. Finally, the function must be able to be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper.Continuous functions are important in mathematics and other fields because they can be studied and analyzed using the tools of calculus, which include techniques such as differentiation and integration. These techniques are used to study the behavior of functions, find the slope of their graphs, and calculate areas under their curves.Examples of continuous functions include polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, and exponential functions.

By combining both using Bayesian statistics, one can compute a posterior, that includes both information sources and therefore stabilizes the estimation process. By trading off both objectives, one chooses to be more addictive to the data or to enforce generalization (to prevent overfitting). There is a whole research branch dealing with all possible regularizations. The work flow usually is, that one tries a specific regularization and then figures out the probability density that corresponds to that regularization to justify the choice. It can also be physically motivated by common sense or intuition.In machine learning, the data term corresponds to the training data and the regularization is either the choice of the model or modifications to the algorithm. It is always intended to reduce the generalization error, i.e. the error score with the trained model on the evaluation set and not the training data.One of the earliest uses of regularization is Tikhonov regularization, related to the method of least squares.",0,wikipedia_csai

This is often done in order to avoid certain types of solutions that may be undesirable or undesirable, such as solutions that are not unique or solutions that produce divergent results.One common example of regularization is the addition of a penalty term to an optimization problem. For example, suppose we have a function that we want to optimize, but we know that the solutions to the optimization problem may not be unique or may have undesirable properties. We can add a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes solutions that have these undesirable properties, which helps to steer the optimization towards solutions that are more desirable.Another example of regularization is the use of smoothing techniques in data fitting and interpolation. When fitting a curve to a set of data points, it is often desirable to find a curve that is smooth and does not oscillate too much between points. By adding a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes the curvature or complexity of the curve, we can encourage the optimization algorithm to find a smoother curve that fits the data better.Regularization is a useful tool in many areas of mathematics, including machine learning, optimization, and signal processing, and it can help to improve the accuracy and stability of mathematical models.",1,wikipedia_csai

48954,18597,"Please explain what is ""Boolean network""","A Boolean network is a mathematical model used to represent the behavior of a dynamic system as a network of Boolean variables and functions. The variables in a Boolean network can have only two states: ""true"" or ""false,"" and the functions specify the rules for how the variables update their states based on the states of other variables in the network.Boolean networks are often used to model the behavior of complex systems, such as genetic regulatory networks or social networks. They are particularly useful for studying the behavior of systems that exhibit binary (either/or) behavior, or for modeling the interactions between different components of a system.In a Boolean network, each variable is represented by a node in the network, and the functions specifying the rules for updating the state of each variable are represented by edges connecting the nodes. The state of the network at any given time can be represented by the configuration of the nodes, and the dynamics of the network can be studied by iteratively updating the state of the nodes according to the rules specified by the edges.Boolean networks have been used in a variety of applications, including the study of cellular automata, the analysis of biological systems, and the design of computer circuits. They have also been used to study the behavior of social and economic systems, as well as the spread of diseases and information.",1,wikipedia_csai

AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.Automatic differentiation is distinct from symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation. Symbolic differentiation faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single mathematical expression and can lead to inefficient code. Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences) can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation. Both of these classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where complexity and errors increase. Finally, both of these classical methods are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems.",0,wikipedia_csai

By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, AD can compute the derivative of the function with respect to any of its inputs, without the need to manually derive the derivative using calculus.There are two main approaches to implementing AD: forward mode and reverse mode. Forward mode AD computes the derivative of the function with respect to each input separately, while reverse mode AD computes the derivative of the function with respect to all of the inputs simultaneously. Reverse mode AD is more efficient when the number of inputs is much larger than the number of outputs, while forward mode AD is more efficient when the number of outputs is larger than the number of inputs.AD has many applications in machine learning, where it is used to compute the gradients of loss functions with respect to the model parameters during training. It is also used in optimization, where it can be used to find the minimum or maximum of a function by gradient descent or other optimization algorithms.

The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U.S. communications networks and information systems. The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine. [10] The existence of the NSA was not revealed until 1975. The NSA has roughly 32,000 employees. [11]Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II, it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952. Between then and the end of the Cold War, it became the largest of the U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget, but information available as of 2013 indicates that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) pulled ahead in this regard, with a budget of $14.7 billion. [12] The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end. [13] The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet, which severely damaged Iran's nuclear program. [14][15] The NSA, alongside the CIA, maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe; the CIA/NSA joint Special Collection Service (a highly classified intelligence team) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets (such as presidential palaces or embassies). SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass ""close surveillance, burglary, wiretapping, [and] breaking and entering"". [16]Unlike the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage, the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering. The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to, and the coordination of, SIGINT elements for other government organizations – which are prevented by Executive Order from engaging in such activities on their own. [17] As part of these responsibilities, the agency has a co-located organization called the Central Security Service (CSS), which facilitates cooperation between the NSA and other U.S. defense cryptanalysis components. To further ensure streamlined communication between the signals intelligence community divisions, the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service.The NSA's actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions, including its spying on anti–Vietnam War leaders and the agency's participation in economic espionage. In 2013, the NSA had many of its secret surveillance programs revealed to the public by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor. According to the leaked documents, the NSA intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide, including United States citizens.

For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, robot control, video games,[10] and healthcare. [11]The name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both ""long-term memory"" and ""short-term memory"". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories. [12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus ""long short-term memory"".A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate. [14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs.

48991,18625,"Please explain what is ""Rule-based programming""","Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:and are read declaratively as logical implications:H is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:In the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.In ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:Consider the following clause as an example:based on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:can be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by ""assigning"" socrates to X.The declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness. Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques can also be used to transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient. In the Prolog family of logic programming languages, the programmer can also use the known problem-solving behaviour of the execution mechanism to improve the efficiency of programs.",0,wikipedia_csai
48992,18625,"Please explain what is ""Rule-based programming""","Rule-based programming is a programming paradigm in which the behavior of a system is defined by a set of rules that describe how the system should respond to specific inputs or situations. These rules are typically expressed in the form of if-then statements, where the ""if"" part of the statement specifies a condition or trigger, and the ""then"" part specifies the action that should be taken if the condition is met.Rule-based systems are often used in artificial intelligence and expert systems, where they are used to encode the knowledge and expertise of a domain expert in a form that can be processed by a computer. They can also be used in other areas of programming, such as natural language processing, where they can be used to define the grammar and syntax of a language, or in automated decision-making systems, where they can be used to evaluate data and make decisions based on predefined rules.One of the key advantages of rule-based programming is that it allows for the creation of systems that can adapt and change their behavior based on new information or changing circumstances. This makes them well-suited for use in dynamic environments, where the rules that govern the system's behavior may need to be modified or updated over time. However, rule-based systems can also be complex and difficult to maintain, as they may require the creation and management of large numbers of rules in order to function properly.",1,wikipedia_csai
48993,18626,"Please explain what is ""Artificial neuron""","An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's action potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function[clarification needed]. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often  monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. Non-monotonic, unbounded and oscillating activation functions with multiple zeros that outperform sigmoidal and ReLU like activation functions on many tasks have also been recently explored. The thresholding function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times.The artificial neuron transfer function should not be confused with a linear system's transfer function.Artificial neurons can also refer to artificial cells in neuromorphic engineering (see below) that are similar to natural physical neurons.",0,wikipedia_csai

Here, continuous means that values can have arbitrarily small variations. [a] Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion. [b]The real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and more generally in all mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives. [c]The set of real numbers is denoted R or R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and is sometimes called ""the reals"".The adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by René Descartes to distinguish real numbers, associated with physical reality, from imaginary numbers (such as the square roots of −1), which seemed like a theoretical contrivance unrelated to physical reality.The real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4 / 3. The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root √2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as π = 3.1415...).Real numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.Conversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.The informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field. [d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations.

It is responsible for mapping an audio signal to a sequence of words or phonemes (the basic units of sound in a language). To do this, the acoustic model uses a set of parameters that describe the characteristics of the audio signal, such as its pitch, duration, and spectral content.

49007,18635,"Please explain what is ""Weight decay""","Ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multiple-regression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated. It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering. Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems. [a] It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).The theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers “RIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems” and “RIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems”. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.Ridge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.",0,wikipedia_csai
49008,18635,"Please explain what is ""Weight decay""","Weight decay is a regularization technique used in machine learning and deep learning to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. It does this by adding a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the weight values of the model. This penalty term is called the weight decay term, and it is typically multiplied by a hyperparameter called the weight decay rate or decay coefficient, which determines the strength of the regularization.In practice, weight decay is often implemented by adding a term to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model weights. This term is the product of the weight decay rate and the weights themselves, and it is subtracted from the original gradient before the weights are updated. For example, in stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the weights are updated according to the following equation:weights = weights - learning_rate * (gradient + weight_decay_rate * weights)The effect of weight decay is to encourage the weights of the model to take smaller values, which can help to prevent overfitting. This is because smaller weights correspond to a simpler model, which is less likely to fit the noise in the training data.Weight decay is often used in conjunction with other regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping, to further improve the generalization performance of the model. It is an important tool for improving the robustness and generalization of machine learning and deep learning models.",1,wikipedia_csai
49009,18636,"Please explain what is ""Sparse matrix""","In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There is no strict definition regarding the proportion of zero-value elements for a matrix to qualify as sparse but a common criterion is that the number of non-zero elements is roughly equal to the number of rows or columns. By contrast, if most of the elements are non-zero, the matrix is considered dense. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m × n for an m × n matrix) is sometimes referred to as the sparsity of the matrix.Conceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. For example, consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls were to have springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application areas such as network theory and numerical analysis, which typically have a low density of significant data or connections. Large sparse matrices often appear in scientific or engineering applications when solving partial differential equations.When storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer, it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Specialized computers have been made for sparse matrices, as they are common in the machine learning field. Operations using standard dense-matrix structures and algorithms are slow and inefficient when applied to large sparse matrices as processing and memory are wasted on the zeros. Sparse data is by nature more easily compressed and thus requires significantly less storage. Some very large sparse matrices are infeasible to manipulate using standard dense-matrix algorithms.",0,wikipedia_csai
49010,18636,"Please explain what is ""Sparse matrix""","A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero.

Storing this matrix as a full matrix would require a large amount of memory, even though most of the elements are zero. By storing the matrix as a sparse matrix, we can save a lot of memory by only storing the non-zero elements and their positions.Sparse matrices can be represented in a number of ways, such as a list of tuples, a dictionary of keys, or a coordinate list. There are also specialized data structures and algorithms for working with sparse matrices, which can be more efficient than using general-purpose matrix operations.Sparse matrices are used in a wide range of applications, including scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

49011,18637,"Please explain what is ""Learning rate""","In machine learning and statistics, the learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Since it influences to what extent newly acquired information overrides old information, it metaphorically represents the speed at which a machine learning model ""learns"". In the adaptive control literature, the learning rate is commonly referred to as gain.In setting a learning rate, there is a trade-off between the rate of convergence and overshooting. While the descent direction is usually determined from the gradient of the loss function, the learning rate determines how big a step is taken in that direction. A too high learning rate will make the learning jump over minima but a too low learning rate will either take too long to converge or get stuck in an undesirable local minimum.In order to achieve faster convergence, prevent oscillations and getting stuck in undesirable local minima the learning rate is often varied during training either in accordance to a learning rate schedule or by using an adaptive learning rate. The learning rate and its adjustments may also differ per parameter, in which case it is a diagonal matrix that can be interpreted as an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian matrix in Newton's method. The learning rate is related to the step length determined by inexact line search in quasi-Newton methods and related optimization algorithms.When conducting line searches, mini-batch sub-sampling (MBSS) affect the characteristics of the loss function along which the learning rate needs to be resolved. Static MBSS keeps the mini-batch fixed along a search direction, resulting in a smooth loss function along the search direction. Dynamic MBSS updates the mini-batch at every function evaluation, resulting in a point-wise discontinuous loss function along the search direction. Line searches that adaptively resolve learning rates for static MBSS loss functions include the parabolic approximation line (PAL) search. Line searches that adaptively resolve learning rates for dynamic MBSS loss functions include probabilistic line searches,[10] gradient-only line searches (GOLS)[11] and quadratic approximations.

49012,18637,"Please explain what is ""Learning rate""","In machine learning, the learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at which the optimizer makes updates to the model parameters. It is a key factor in the training process of a neural network, as it controls how fast or slow the model learns.The learning rate is usually set before training the model and remains constant throughout the training process. A larger learning rate means that the model will make larger updates to the model parameters with each training step, while a smaller learning rate means that the updates will be smaller.There are a few different approaches to setting the learning rate. One approach is to manually set the learning rate to a fixed value, but this can be difficult because the optimal learning rate can vary widely depending on the specific model and dataset. A more common approach is to use a learning rate schedule, which adjusts the learning rate over time based on the performance of the model. For example, the learning rate may start off high and then gradually decrease as training progresses.It's important to choose an appropriate learning rate, as a learning rate that is too high can cause the model to diverge and a learning rate that is too low can make the training process slow and inefficient. Finding the right balance is key to successfully training a machine learning model.",1,wikipedia_csai
49013,18638,"Please explain what is ""Hyperparameter optimization""","In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are learned.The same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem. Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined loss function on given independent data. The objective function takes a tuple of hyperparameters and returns the associated loss. Cross-validation is often used to estimate this generalization performance.",0,wikipedia_csai
49014,18638,"Please explain what is ""Hyperparameter optimization""","Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the optimal values for a model's hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a model, and they can greatly impact the performance of a model. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate for training a neural network, the number of layers and neurons in a network, the type of loss function to use, and the regularization strength.Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in the process of building and training a machine learning model. Choosing the right hyperparameters can make a big difference in the accuracy and efficiency of a model. There are several methods that can be used to optimize hyperparameters, including manual tuning, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.In manual tuning, the hyperparameters are selected by the practitioner based on their experience and knowledge of the problem. This can be time-consuming and may not always lead to the best results.In grid search, the practitioner defines a grid of hyperparameter values and the model is trained and evaluated using each combination of values. This can be computationally expensive, especially for large grids and complex models.In random search, the practitioner defines a distribution of hyperparameter values and a random set of values is drawn from this distribution for each iteration. This can be less computationally expensive than grid search, but it may not be as thorough.Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses Bayesian statistics to model the function being optimized and then selects the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate based on this model. This can be more efficient than grid search or random search, but it can be more complex to implement.",1,wikipedia_csai

It was developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium, a group of biologists, bioinformaticians, and data scientists who work to improve the interoperability of biological data.The Gene Ontology consists of three main categories of terms: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. Molecular function describes the specific biochemical activity of a gene product, such as catalyzing a chemical reaction or binding to a particular molecule. Cellular component refers to the location or structure in which a gene product functions, such as a membrane or organelle. Biological process describes the larger processes in which a gene product is involved, such as cell division or immune response.GO terms are organized in a hierarchical structure, with more specific terms being subsumed under more general terms.

However, it is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions of partial differential equations. There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific research on methods to numerically approximate solutions of certain partial differential equations using computers. Partial differential equations also occupy a large sector of pure mathematical research, in which the usual questions are, broadly speaking, on the identification of general qualitative features of solutions of various partial differential equations, such as existence, uniqueness, regularity, and stability. [citation needed] Among the many open questions are the existence and smoothness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, named as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in mathematically oriented scientific fields, such as physics and engineering. For instance, they are foundational in the modern scientific understanding of sound, heat, diffusion, electrostatics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation, Pauli equation, etc). They also arise from many purely mathematical considerations, such as differential geometry and the calculus of variations; among other notable applications, they are the fundamental tool in the proof of the Poincaré conjecture from geometric topology.Partly due to this variety of sources, there is a wide spectrum of different types of partial differential equations, and methods have been developed for dealing with many of the individual equations which arise. As such, it is usually acknowledged that there is no ""general theory"" of partial differential equations, with specialist knowledge being somewhat divided between several essentially distinct subfields.Ordinary differential equations form a subclass of partial differential equations, corresponding to functions of a single variable.

They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842–1850 (Stokes).The Navier–Stokes equations mathematically express conservation of momentum and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids. They are sometimes accompanied by an equation of state relating pressure, temperature  and density. They arise from applying Isaac Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term—hence describing viscous flow. The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier–Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow. As a result, the Navier–Stokes are a parabolic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable).The Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with Maxwell's equations, they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether smooth solutions always exist in three dimensions—i.e., whether they are infinitely differentiable (or even just bounded) at all points in the domain. This is called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem.

Although maximum lifespan would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because longitudinal studies would take far too much time. Ideally, biomarkers of aging should assay the biological process of aging and not a predisposition to disease, should cause a minimal amount of trauma to assay in the organism, and should be reproducibly measurable during a short interval compared to the lifespan of the organism. An assemblage of biomarker data for an organism could be termed its ""ageotype"".Although graying of hair increases with age, hair graying cannot be called a biomarker of ageing. Similarly, skin wrinkles and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. Biogerontologists have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited. Levels of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells and naive T cells have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.Advances in big data analysis allowed for the new types of ""aging clocks"" to be developed. The epigenetic clock is a promising biomarker of aging and can accurately predict human chronological age. Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age. Further studies of the hematological clock on the large datasets from South Korean, Canadian, and Eastern European populations demonstrated that biomarkers of aging may be population-specific and predictive of mortality.It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the transcriptomic clock.The recent introduction of low-power and compact sensors, based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) has led to a new breed of the wearable and affordable devices providing unparalleled opportunities for the collecting and cloud-storing personal digitized activity records.

Their research may have a range of practical applications, including the development of new treatments for brain disorders and the design of more effective educational and training programs.",1,wikipedia_csai
49071,18679,"Please explain what is ""Deductive reasoning""","Deductive reasoning is the mental process of drawing deductive inferences. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its premises, i.e. if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises ""all men are mortal"" and ""Socrates is a man"" to the conclusion ""Socrates is mortal"" is deductively valid. An argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true. Some theorists define deduction in terms of the intentions of the author: they have to intend for the premises to offer deductive support to the conclusion. With the help of this modification, it is possible to distinguish valid from invalid deductive reasoning: it is invalid if the author's belief about the deductive support is false, but even invalid deductive reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning. Psychology is interested in deductive reasoning as a psychological process, i.e. how people actually draw inferences. Logic, on the other hand, focuses on the deductive relation of logical consequence between the premises and the conclusion or how people should draw inferences. There are different ways of conceptualizing this relation. According to the semantic approach, an argument is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible interpretation of this argument where its premises are true and its conclusion is false. The syntactic approach, on the other hand, holds that an argument is deductively valid if and only if its conclusion can be deduced from its premises using a valid rule of inference. A rule of inference is a schema of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises based only on their logical form. There are various rules of inference, like the modus ponens and the modus tollens. Invalid deductive arguments, which do not follow a rule of inference, are called formal fallacies. Rules of inference are definitory rules and contrast to strategic rules, which specify what inferences one needs to draw in order to arrive at an intended conclusion. Deductive reasoning contrasts with non-deductive or ampliative reasoning. For ampliative arguments, like inductive or abductive arguments, the premises offer weaker support to their conclusion: they make it more likely but they do not guarantee its truth. They make up for this drawback by being able to provide genuinely new information not already found in the premises, unlike deductive arguments.Cognitive psychology investigates the mental processes responsible for deductive reasoning. One of its topics concerns the factors determining whether people draw valid or invalid deductive inferences. One factor is the form of the argument: for example, people are more successful for arguments of the form modus ponens than for modus tollens. Another is the content of the arguments: people are more likely to believe that an argument is valid if the claim made in its conclusion is plausible. A general finding is that people tend to perform better for realistic and concrete cases than for abstract cases. Psychological theories of deductive reasoning aim to explain these findings by providing an account of the underlying psychological processes. Mental logic theories hold that deductive reasoning is a language-like process that happens through the manipulation of representations using rules of inference. Mental model theories, on the other hand, claim that deductive reasoning involves models of possible states of the world without the medium of language or rules of inference. According to dual-process theories of reasoning, there are two qualitatively different cognitive systems responsible for reasoning.The problem of deductive reasoning is relevant to various fields and issues. Epistemology tries to understand how justification is transferred from the belief in the premises to the belief in the conclusion in the process of deductive reasoning. Probability logic studies how the probability of the premises of an inference affects the probability of its conclusion. The controversial thesis of deductivism denies that there are other correct forms of inference besides deduction. Natural deduction is a type of proof system based on simple and self-evident rules of inference. In philosophy, the geometrical method is a way of philosophizing that starts from a small set of self-evident axioms and tries to build a comprehensive logical system using deductive reasoning.",0,wikipedia_csai
49072,18679,"Please explain what is ""Deductive reasoning""","Deductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking in which a conclusion is drawn based on the relationship between two or more premises. This type of reasoning starts with a general statement, or premise, and applies it to a specific situation to arrive at a logical conclusion.For example, consider the following argument:Premise 1: All birds can fly.Premise 2: Eagles are birds.Conclusion: Therefore, eagles can fly.In this example, the conclusion that eagles can fly is drawn based on the relationship between the two premises: that all birds can fly and that eagles are birds. The conclusion follows logically from the premises.Deductive reasoning is often contrasted with inductive reasoning, which involves drawing conclusions based on observations or specific examples. While deductive reasoning is a reliable method for arriving at conclusions when the premises are true, it is not always possible to determine the truth of the premises with certainty. In such cases, the conclusion may not necessarily be reliable.",1,wikipedia_csai

Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by the Scott Trust. The trust was created in 1936 to ""secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference"". The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008, with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators. Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders. It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK.The editor-in-chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015. [10][11] Since 2018, the paper's main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format. As of July 2021[update], its print edition had a daily circulation of 105,134. The newspaper has an online edition, TheGuardian.com, as well as two international websites, Guardian Australia (founded in 2013) and Guardian US (founded in 2011). The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion,[12][13] and the term ""Guardian reader"" is used to imply a stereotype of liberal, left-wing or ""politically correct"" views. Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the ""Grauniad"" in the 1960s, a nickname still used occasionally by the editors for self-mockery. [14]In an Ipsos MORI research poll in September 2018 designed to interrogate the public's trust of specific titles online, The Guardian scored highest for digital-content news, with 84% of readers agreeing that they ""trust what [they] see in it"". [15] A December 2018 report of a poll by the Publishers Audience Measurement Company stated that the paper's print edition was found to be the most trusted in the UK in the period from October 2017 to September 2018. It was also reported to be the most-read of the UK's ""quality newsbrands"", including digital editions; other ""quality"" brands included The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, and the i. While The Guardian's print circulation is in decline, the report indicated that news from The Guardian, including that reported online, reaches more than 23 million UK adults each month. [16]Chief among the notable ""scoops"" obtained by the paper was the 2011 News International phone-hacking scandal—and in particular the hacking of the murdered English teenager Milly Dowler's phone. [17] The investigation led to the closure of the News of the World, the UK's best-selling Sunday newspaper and one of the highest-circulation newspapers in history. [18] In June 2013, The Guardian broke news of the secret collection by the Obama administration of Verizon telephone records,[19] and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program PRISM after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. [20] In 2016, The Guardian led an investigation into the Panama Papers, exposing then–Prime Minister David Cameron's links to offshore bank accounts. It has been named ""newspaper of the year"" four times at the annual British Press Awards: most recently in 2014, for its reporting on government surveillance. [21]",0,wikipedia_csai

Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself.

The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining).

49117,18710,"Please explain what is ""Automated medical diagnosis""","Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.CAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain.CAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.Although CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.",0,wikipedia_csai

49119,18712,"Please explain what is ""Symbolic artificial intelligence""","In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel's Checker's Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition. [10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning. [11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant's PAC learning, Quinlan's ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations. [10]Neural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012. Early examples are Rosenblatt's perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989. [14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: ""Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn't work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks. ""[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.

It involves representing knowledge about the world in the form of symbols and using logical rules to manipulate these symbols to perform tasks such as problem-solving, planning, and decision-making.Symbolic AI systems are designed to represent and reason with explicit, declarative knowledge, which is knowledge that can be expressed in a symbolic form and can be manipulated and processed by a computer. These systems use logical rules and symbolic representations to represent knowledge and to make inferences about the world. They rely on pre-defined rules and logical reasoning to solve problems and make decisions, rather than learning from data or experience like some other approaches to artificial intelligence.One of the key advantages of symbolic AI is that it allows for the explicit representation of complex knowledge and logical reasoning. This can be useful in situations where there are clear rules and logical relationships between different pieces of information, and where it is important to be able to explain the reasoning behind a decision.

Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the probability measure, to a set of outcomes called the sample space. Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event.Central subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion).Although it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.As a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics or sequential estimation.

These probabilities are typically expressed as decimal values between 0 and 1, with 0 representing an impossible event and 1 representing a certain event. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and it landing on heads is 0.5, because there is an equal chance of either outcome occurring.Probability theory is used in a wide range of fields, including finance, engineering, and the natural and social sciences.

An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc. ), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.In statistics, typically a  loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century. In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret. In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cramér in the 1920s.

Each observation measures one or more properties (such as weight, location, colour or mass) of independent objects or individuals. In survey sampling, weights can be applied to the data to adjust for the sample design, particularly in stratified sampling. Results from probability theory and statistical theory are employed to guide the practice. In business and medical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a population. Acceptance sampling is used to determine if a production lot of material meets the governing specifications.",0,wikipedia_csai

This means that the sample should be similar to the population in terms of important characteristics such as age, gender, education level, and income. If a sample is representative of the population, then the results of the analysis can be generalized to the population as a whole.In summary, a sample in statistics is a subset of observations drawn from a population, and it is used to make inferences about the population.

In addition, when splitting a node during the construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the best split among all features. Instead, the split that is picked is the best split among a random subset of the features. As a result, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with respect to the bias of a single non-random tree) but, due to averaging, its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.Random forests have been successful in many practical applications, such as recommending products on e-commerce websites, banking, disease diagnosis, and image classification.",1,wikipedia_csai

It allows us to understand how much of the model's prediction error is due to bias, and how much is due to variance.Bias is the difference between the predicted values of the model and the true values. A model with high bias tends to make the same prediction error consistently, regardless of the input data. This is because the model is oversimplified and does not capture the complexity of the problem.Variance, on the other hand, is the variability of the model's predictions for a given input. A model with high variance tends to make large prediction errors for certain inputs, but smaller errors for others. This is because the model is overly sensitive to the specific characteristics of the training data, and may not generalize well to unseen data.By understanding the bias and variance of a model, we can identify ways to improve its performance.

49137,18726,"Please explain what is ""Time complexity""","In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. : 226  Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically O(n){\displaystyle O(n)}, O(nlog⁡n){\displaystyle O(n\log n)}, O(nα){\displaystyle O(n^{\alpha })}, O(2n){\displaystyle O(2^{n})}, etc., where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the input.Algorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation. For example, an algorithm with time complexity O(n){\displaystyle O(n)} is a linear time algorithm and an algorithm with time complexity O(nα){\displaystyle O(n^{\alpha })} for some constant α>1{\displaystyle \alpha >1} is a polynomial time algorithm.",0,wikipedia_csai

Probability density  is the  probability per unit length,  in other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.In a more precise sense, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variable's PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and the area under the entire curve is equal to 1.The terms ""probability distribution function"" and ""probability function"" have also sometimes been used to denote the probability density function. However, this use is not standard among probabilists and statisticians. In other sources, ""probability distribution function"" may be used when the probability distribution is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the cumulative distribution function, or it may be a probability mass function (PMF) rather than the density. ""Density function"" itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion.

The probability of a specific range of values occurring is equal to the area under the curve of the PDF within that range.For example, consider a continuous random variable X that has a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ.

The objective is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any delay, overshoot, or steady-state error and ensuring a level of control stability; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality.To do this, a controller with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  controllability and observability. Control theory is used in control system engineering to design automation  that have revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries, and created new fields such as robotics. Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram. In it the transfer function, also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system.Control theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell. Control theory was further advanced by Edward Routh in 1874, Charles Sturm and in 1895, Adolf Hurwitz, who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria; and from 1922 onwards, the development of PID control theory by Nicolas Minorsky.Although a major application of mathematical control theory is in control systems engineering, which deals with the design of process control systems for industry, other applications range far beyond this.

49161,18742,"Please explain what is ""Meta-learning (computer science)""","Meta learningis a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied to metadata about machine learning experiments. As of 2017 the term had not found a standard interpretation, however the main goal is to use such metadata to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving learning problems, hence to improve the performance of existing learning algorithms or to learn (induce) the learning algorithm itself, hence the alternative term learning to learn.Flexibility is important because each learning algorithm is based on a set of assumptions about the data, its inductive bias. This means that it will only learn well if the bias matches the learning problem. A learning algorithm may perform very well in one domain, but not on the next. This poses strong restrictions on the use of machine learning or data mining techniques, since the relationship between the learning problem (often some kind of database) and the effectiveness of different learning algorithms is not yet understood.By using different kinds of metadata, like properties of the learning problem, algorithm properties (like performance measures), or patterns previously derived from the data, it is possible to learn, select, alter or combine different learning algorithms to effectively solve a given learning problem. Critiques of meta learning approaches bear a strong resemblance to the critique of metaheuristic, a possibly related problem. A good analogy to meta-learning, and the inspiration for Jürgen Schmidhuber's early work (1987) and Yoshua Bengio et al. 's work (1991), considers that genetic evolution learns the learning procedure encoded in genes and executed in each individual's brain. In an open-ended hierarchical meta learning system using genetic programming, better evolutionary methods can be learned by meta evolution, which itself can be improved by meta meta evolution, etc.See also Ensemble learning.",0,wikipedia_csai

Multilayer perceptrons are sometimes colloquially referred to as ""vanilla"" neural networks, especially when they have a single hidden layer.An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.",0,wikipedia_csai

The output layer produces the final output of the MLP, which can be used for various tasks such as classification or prediction.MLPs are often used for supervised learning tasks, in which the goal is to learn a function that maps input data to output labels or values. They are particularly useful for tasks that require the modeling of complex relationships between the input data and the output labels.MLPs are a simple and powerful tool for many machine learning tasks, but they can be limited by the fact that they do not have the ability to process inputs that are not provided in their input layer.

49165,18745,"Please explain what is ""Dictionary learning""","Sparse coding is a representation learning method which aims at finding a sparse representation of the input data (also known as sparse coding) in the form of a linear combination of basic elements as well as those basic elements themselves. These elements are called atoms and they compose a dictionary. Atoms in the dictionary are not required to be orthogonal, and they may be an over-complete spanning set. This problem setup also allows the dimensionality of the signals being represented to be higher than the one of the signals being observed. The above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representations of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation.One of the most important applications of sparse dictionary learning is in the field of compressed sensing or signal recovery. In compressed sensing, a high-dimensional signal can be recovered with only a few linear measurements provided that the signal is sparse or nearly sparse. Since not all signals satisfy this sparsity condition, it is of great importance to find a sparse representation of that signal such as the wavelet transform or the directional gradient of a rasterized matrix. Once a matrix or a high dimensional vector is transferred to a sparse space, different recovery algorithms like basis pursuit, CoSaMP or fast non-iterative algorithms can be used to recover the signal.One of the key principles of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data. The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated by the fact that in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible. Before this approach the general practice was to use predefined dictionaries (such as Fourier or wavelet transforms). However, in certain cases a dictionary that is trained to fit the input data can significantly improve the sparsity, which has applications in data decomposition, compression and analysis and has been used in the fields of image denoising and classification, video and audio processing. Sparsity and overcomplete dictionaries have immense applications in image compression, image fusion and inpainting.",0,wikipedia_csai

It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.Besides the term clustering, there is a number of terms with similar meanings, including automatic classification, numerical taxonomy, botryology (from Greek βότρυς ""grape""), typological analysis, and community detection. The subtle differences are often in the use of the results: while in data mining, the resulting groups are the matter of interest, in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest.Cluster analysis was originated in anthropology by Driver and Kroeber in 1932 and introduced to psychology by Joseph Zubin in 1938 and Robert Tryon in 1939 and famously used by Cattell beginning in 1943 for trait theory classification in personality psychology.",0,wikipedia_csai

Noise reduction algorithms may distort the signal to some degree. Noise rejection is the ability of a circuit to isolate an undesired signal component from the desired signal component, as with common-mode rejection ratio.All signal processing devices, both analog and digital, have traits that make them susceptible to noise. Noise can be random with an even frequency distribution (white noise), or frequency-dependent noise introduced by a device's mechanism or signal processing algorithms.In electronic systems, a major type of noise is hiss created by random electron motion due to thermal agitation. These agitated electrons rapidly add and subtract from the output signal and thus create detectable noise.In the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger-sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise.

In almost all systems and processes, the application of affinity analysis can extract significant knowledge about the unexpected trends. In fact, affinity analysis takes advantages of studying attributes that go together which helps uncover the hidden pattens in a big data through generating association rules. Association rules mining procedure is two-fold: first, it finds all frequent attributes in a data set and, then generates association rules satisfying some predefined criteria, support and confidence, to identify the most important relationships in the frequent itemset. The first step in the process is to count the co-occurrence of attributes in the data set. Next, a subset is created called the frequent itemset. The association rules mining takes the form of if a condition or feature (A) is present then another condition or feature (B) exists. The first condition or feature (A) is called antecedent and the latter (B) is known as consequent. This process is repeated until no additional frequent itemsets are found. There are two important metrics for performing the association rules mining technique: support and confidence. Also, a priori algorithm is used to reduce the search space for the problem.The support metric in the association rule learning algorithm is defined as the frequency of the antecedent or consequent appearing together in a data set.

Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:and are read declaratively as logical implications:H is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:In the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.In ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:Consider the following clause as an example:based on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:can be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by ""assigning"" socrates to X.The declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness. Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques can also be used to transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient.

49193,18765,"Please explain what is ""Functional programming""","In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.Functional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming which treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects. This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative programming, which can have side effects (such as modifying the program's state or taking input from a user). Proponents of purely functional programming claim that by restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification.Functional programming has its roots in academia, evolving from the lambda calculus, a formal system of computation based only on functions. Functional programming has historically been less popular than imperative programming, but many functional languages are seeing use today in industry and education, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang,[10][11][12] Elixir,[13] OCaml,[14][15] Haskell,[16][17] and F#. [18][19] Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, like JavaScript in the Web,[20] R in statistics,[21][22] J, K and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery/XSLT for XML. [23][24] Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, such as not allowing mutable values. [25] In addition, many other programming languages support programming in a functional style or have implemented features from functional programming, such as C++11, C#,[26] Kotlin,[27] Perl,[28] PHP,[29] Python,[30] Go,[31] Rust,[32] Raku,[33] Scala,[34] and Java (since Java 8).

Functions in functional programming do not have side effects, meaning that they do not modify the state of the program or produce any observable interactions with the outside world, such as printing to the console or modifying a file on the filesystem.Functional programming languages often use recursive functions, which are functions that call themselves, to perform complex computations. They also typically use higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as output.Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s by mathematician Alonzo Church to study the concept of functions.

Informal metaphors help to explain this technique, such as falling dominoes or climbing a ladder:A proof by induction consists of two cases. The first, the base case, proves the statement for n = 0 without assuming any knowledge of other cases. The second case, the induction step, proves that if the statement holds for any given case n = k, then it must also hold for the next case n = k + 1. These two steps establish that the statement holds for every natural number n. The base case does not necessarily begin with n = 0, but often with n = 1, and possibly with any fixed natural number n = N, establishing the truth of the statement for all natural numbers n ≥ N.The method can be extended to prove statements about more general well-founded structures, such as trees; this generalization, known as structural induction, is used in mathematical logic and computer science. Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion. Mathematical induction is an inference rule used in formal proofs, and is the foundation of most correctness proofs for computer programs.Although its name may suggest otherwise, mathematical induction should not be confused with inductive reasoning as used in philosophy (see Problem of induction). The mathematical method examines infinitely many cases to prove a general statement, but does so by a finite chain of deductive reasoning involving the variable n, which can take infinitely many values.",0,wikipedia_csai
49200,18769,"Please explain what is ""Mathematical induction""","Mathematical induction is a method of proof that is used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers (positive integers). It is based on the idea that if a statement is true for the base case (usually 0 or 1), and if the statement is true for one natural number, then it must be true for the next natural number. This process is then repeated until the statement has been proven for all natural numbers.To prove a statement using mathematical induction, you must first prove that the statement is true for the base case. For example, if you want to prove that the statement ""for all natural numbers n, the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to n(n+1)/2"" is true, you would need to prove that it is true for the base case n = 0. In this case, the sum of the first 0 natural numbers is 0, and 0(0+1)/2 = 0, so the statement is true for the base case.Once you have proved that the statement is true for the base case, you must then assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number, say k. Using this assumption, you must then prove that the statement must be true for the next natural number, k+1. For example, if you are trying to prove the statement above, you would assume that the sum of the first k natural numbers is equal to k(k+1)/2, and then use this assumption to prove that the sum of the first k+1 natural numbers is equal to (k+1)(k+2)/2.If you can successfully prove the statement for the base case and for the next natural number, then you can use mathematical induction to conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers. This is because the base case and the next natural number are both true, and if the statement is true for one natural number, it must also be true for the next natural number, and so on. Therefore, by repeating this process indefinitely, you can prove that the statement is true for all natural numbers.",1,wikipedia_csai

Here, continuous means that values can have arbitrarily small variations. [a] Every real number can be almost uniquely represented by an infinite decimal expansion. [b]The real numbers are fundamental in calculus (and more generally in all mathematics), in particular by their role in the classical definitions of limits, continuity and derivatives. [c]The set of real numbers is denoted R or R{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} } and is sometimes called ""the reals"".The adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by René Descartes to distinguish real numbers, associated with physical reality, from imaginary numbers (such as the square roots of −1), which seemed like a theoretical contrivance unrelated to physical reality.The real numbers include the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4 / 3. The rest of the real numbers are called irrational numbers, and include algebraic numbers (such as the square root √2 = 1.414...) and transcendental numbers (such as π = 3.1415...).Real numbers can be thought of as all points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) are equally spaced.Conversely, analytic geometry is the association of points on lines (especially axis lines) to real numbers such that geometric displacements are proportional to differences between corresponding numbers.The informal descriptions above of the real numbers are not sufficient for ensuring the correctness of proofs of theorems involving real numbers. The realization that a better definition was needed, and the elaboration of such a definition was a major development of 19th-century mathematics and is the foundation of real analysis, the study of real functions and real-valued sequences. A current axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique (up to an isomorphism) Dedekind-complete ordered field. [d] Other common definitions of real numbers include equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, and infinite decimal representations.

Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of detection theory to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an email determining how likely that it is spam.Models can use one or more classifiers in trying to determine the probability of a set of data belonging to another set. For example, a model might be used to determine whether an email is spam or ""ham"" (non-spam).Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of machine learning, as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as predictive analytics.Predictive modelling is often contrasted with causal modelling/analysis. In the former, one may be entirely satisfied to make use of indicators of, or proxies for, the outcome of interest. In the latter, one seeks to determine true cause-and-effect relationships.

Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent. These constraints mean there are no cycles or ""loops"" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many trees cannot be represented by relationships between neighboring nodes in a single straight line.Binary trees are a commonly used type, which constrain the number of children for each parent to exactly two. When the order of the children is specified, this data structure corresponds to an  ordered tree in graph theory. A value or pointer to other data may be associated with every node in the tree, or sometimes only with the leaf nodes, which have no children.The abstract data type can be represented in a number of ways, including a list of parents with pointers to children, a list of children with pointers to parents, or a list of nodes and a separate list of parent-child relations (a specific type of adjacency list).

It is often used when the predicted probabilities of a classifier are poorly calibrated, meaning that the predicted probabilities do not accurately reflect the true probabilities of the predicted classes.To apply Platt scaling, you need to have a set of predicted probabilities for a binary classification task and the corresponding true labels. You can then fit a sigmoid curve to these predicted probabilities using a maximum likelihood optimization procedure. The sigmoid curve maps the predicted probabilities to a new scale that is better calibrated with the true probabilities.For example, suppose you have a classifier that predicts the probability of an email being spam. Without Platt scaling, the classifier might output probabilities that are too high or too low, leading to poor performance in terms of precision and recall. By applying Platt scaling, you can adjust the predicted probabilities to be more accurately calibrated with the true labels, resulting in improved performance on the classification task.Platt scaling is a simple and effective way to improve the predictive probability of a binary classifier, and it is widely used in various applications, such as spam filtering and credit risk assessment.",1,wikipedia_csai

The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., a similarity function over all pairs of data points computed using Inner products. The feature map in kernel machines is infinite dimensional but only requires a finite dimensional matrix from user-input according to the Representer theorem. Kernel machines are slow to compute for datasets larger than a couple of thousand examples without parallel processing. Kernel methods  owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space. This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the coordinates. This approach is called the ""kernel trick"". Kernel functions have been introduced for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors.Algorithms capable of operating with kernels include the kernel perceptron, support-vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes, principal components analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis, ridge regression, spectral clustering, linear adaptive filters and many others.Most kernel algorithms are based on convex optimization or eigenproblems and are statistically well-founded.

This is possible because the kernel function acts as a similarity measure between data points, and allows us to compare points in the original feature space using the inner product of their transformed representations in the higher-dimensional space.The kernel trick is commonly used in support vector machines (SVMs) and other types of kernel-based learning algorithms. It allows these algorithms to make use of non-linear decision boundaries, which can be more effective at separating different classes of data in some cases.For example, consider a dataset that contains two classes of data points that are not linearly separable in the original feature space.

This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine function of those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is used. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.Linear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously, and to be used extensively in practical applications. This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters and because the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.Linear regression has many practical uses. Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:Linear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the ""lack of fit"" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares cost function as in ridge regression (L2-norm penalty) and lasso (L1-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms ""least squares"" and ""linear model"" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.",0,wikipedia_csai
49224,18783,"Please explain what is ""Linear regression""","Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a widely used technique for predicting a continuous outcome.In linear regression, the relationship between the dependent variable (which is the variable we are trying to predict) and the independent variable(s) (which are the factors that might influence the dependent variable) is modeled using a linear equation. The equation has the form:y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xnwhere y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, and b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are the regression coefficients. The coefficients represent the relationships between the dependent and independent variables.For example, if we wanted to predict the price of a house based on its size (in square feet), we could use linear regression to model the relationship between the size of a house (the independent variable) and its price (the dependent variable). The model would be trained on data where the size of the house and its price are known, and then we can use the model to predict the price of a house given its size.Linear regression is a simple and widely used technique, but it has some limitations. It assumes that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear, which may not always be the case. In addition, it assumes that the relationship between the variables is additive, meaning that the effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable is constant regardless of the values of the other independent variables.",1,wikipedia_csai

Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.The explanatory (independent) variables resulting from the polynomial expansion of the ""baseline"" variables are known as higher-degree terms.

The general form of a polynomial regression model is given by:y = b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + ... + bn*x^nwhere b0, b1, ..., bn are the coefficients of the polynomial, and x is the independent variable. The degree of the polynomial (i.e., the value of n) determines the flexibility of the model. A higher degree polynomial can capture more complex relationships between x and y, but it can also lead to overfitting if the model is not well-tuned.To fit a polynomial regression model, you need to choose the degree of the polynomial and estimate the coefficients of the polynomial. This can be done using standard linear regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) or gradient descent.Polynomial regression is useful for modeling relationships between variables that are not linear. It can be used to fit a curve to a set of data points and make predictions about future values of the dependent variable based on new values of the independent variable.

They are a useful tool for modeling and analyzing data, particularly in the fields of machine learning, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence.There are two main types of graphical models: directed graphical models, also known as Bayesian networks, and undirected graphical models, also known as Markov random fields. In a directed graphical model, the edges in the graph represent a causal relationship between the variables, while in an undirected graphical model, the edges represent a statistical relationship between the variables.Graphical models provide a powerful framework for representing and reasoning about complex systems, and have been applied to a wide range of problems, including speech recognition, image classification, natural language processing, and many others.",1,wikipedia_csai

49230,18790,"Please explain what is ""Conditional independence""","Conditional independence is a statistical concept that refers to the absence of a relationship between two variables, given the value of a third variable. In other words, if we know the value of the third variable, the presence or absence of a relationship between the other two variables does not change.For example, consider a study on the relationship between income and education level. The relationship between these two variables might be strong - that is, people with higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes. However, if we introduce a third variable, such as race, into the analysis, the relationship between income and education level might become weaker or disappear altogether. This is because race could be a confounding variable that influences both income and education level. In this case, we would say that income and education level are conditionally independent given race.Conditional independence can be useful for statistical modeling and data analysis, as it allows us to identify and control for confounding variables that might influence the relationships between other variables.

Examples include the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. Stochastic processes have applications in many disciplines such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, physics,[10] image processing, signal processing,[11] control theory,[12] information theory,[13] computer science,[14] cryptography[15] and telecommunications. [16] Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance. [17][18][19]Applications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process,[a] used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse,[22] and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time. [23] These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes,[24] and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries. [22][25]The term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process,[26][27] because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space. [28][29] The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables. [28][30] But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line. [30] If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead. [31] The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects. [29]Based on their mathematical properties, stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories, which include random walks,[32] martingales,[33] Markov processes,[34] Lévy processes,[35] Gaussian processes,[36] random fields,[37] renewal processes, and branching processes. [38] The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology[39][40][41] as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis.

49255,18813,"Please explain what is ""Test set""","In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.The model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.Finally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term ""validation set"" is sometimes used instead of ""test set"" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).Deciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available.",0,wikipedia_csai
49256,18813,"Please explain what is ""Test set""","A test set is a set of data used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It is a dataset that is used to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data, or to evaluate the model's performance on a specific task. The test set is usually held out from the training data, and is used to evaluate the model's performance after it has been trained on the training data.The goal of using a test set is to estimate the model's performance on unseen data. This is important because the ultimate goal of machine learning is to build models that can generalize to new data and accurately predict the outcomes of new observations.To create a test set, you typically split your dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's final performance.It is important to note that the test set should be representative of the data the model will be used on in the real world.

Individuals for which the condition is satisfied are considered ""positive"" and those for which it is not are considered ""negative"".If the true condition can not be known, a ""gold standard test"" is assumed to be correct. In a diagnostic test, sensitivity is a measure of how well a test can identify true positives and specificity is a measure of how well a test can identify true negatives. For all testing, both diagnostic and screening, there is usually a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, such that higher sensitivities will mean lower specificities and vice versa.If the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as having the condition, the number of true positives should be high and the number of false negatives should be very low, which results in high sensitivity. This is especially important when the consequence of failing to treat the condition is serious and/or the treatment is very effective and has minimal side effects.If the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as not having the condition, the number of true negatives should be high and the number of false positives should be very low, which results in high specificity. That is, people highly likely to be excluded by the test. This is especially important when people who are identified as having a condition may be subjected to more testing, expense, stigma, anxiety, etc.The terms ""sensitivity"" and ""specificity"" were introduced by American biostatistician Jacob Yerushalmy in 1947.",0,wikipedia_csai

A test with high sensitivity will correctly identify most people with the disease, while a test with low sensitivity will miss many cases of the disease.Specificity, on the other hand, refers to the proportion of negative cases that are correctly identified by the test. It is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who do not have the disease. A test with high specificity will correctly identify most people who do not have the disease, while a test with low specificity will incorrectly identify many people as having the disease when they do not.Both sensitivity and specificity are important characteristics of a diagnostic test, as a test with high sensitivity will accurately identify most cases of the disease, while a test with high specificity will accurately rule out most cases where the disease is not present.

49259,18818,"Please explain what is ""Receiver operating characteristic""","A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The method was originally developed for operators of military radar receivers starting in 1941, which led to its name.The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection. [10] The false-positive rate is also known as probability of false alarm[10] and can be calculated as (1 − specificity). The ROC can also be thought of as a plot of the power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity or recall as a function of fall-out. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from −∞{\displaystyle -\infty } to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.The ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields and was soon introduced to psychology to account for perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis since then has been used in medicine, radiology, biometrics, forecasting of natural hazards,[11] meteorology,[12] model performance assessment,[13] and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research.The ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.

The true positive rate is the number of true positive results divided by the total number of positive results, while the false positive rate is the number of false positive results divided by the total number of negative results.The ROC curve is a useful tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of different classifier models. A classifier with an ROC curve that is farther to the top left corner of the plot (toward the point (0,1)) is considered to be a better classifier, because it is able to correctly identify more positive cases while also minimizing the number of false positive cases.In addition to the ROC curve, the area under the curve (AUC) is often used as a metric for evaluating classifier performance.

In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors, spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors, among others. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g., using Python based frameworks such as snnTorch,[10] or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g., using BindsNet. [11]A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.Neuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and electronic engineering to design artificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems.

49265,18824,"Please explain what is ""Chemical synapse""","Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be sent to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body.At a chemical synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules into a small space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are contained within small sacs called synaptic vesicles, and are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. These molecules then bind to neurotransmitter receptors on the postsynaptic cell. Finally, the neurotransmitters are cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the presynaptic cell or on some other neuroglia to terminate the action of the neurotransmitter.The adult human brain is estimated to contain from 1014 to 5 × 1014 (100–500 trillion) synapses. Every cubic millimeter of cerebral cortex contains roughly a billion (short scale, i.e. 109) of them. The number of synapses in the  human cerebral cortex has separately been estimated at 0.15 quadrillion (150 trillion)The word ""synapse"" was introduced by Sir Charles Scott Sherrington in 1897.

This causes the release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse, or the small gap between the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. The neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, initiating a response in the form of an electrical signal or a change in the cell's biochemical activity.Chemical synapses are essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system, as they allow for the rapid and precise transmission of signals between neurons and other cells.

There are various approaches with advantages and disadvantages in terms of decreased latency, increased throughput and reduced energy consumption. Typical advantages of focusing on software may include more rapid development, lower non-recurring engineering costs, heightened portability, and ease of updating features or patching bugs, at the cost of overhead to compute general operations. Advantages of focusing on hardware may include speedup, reduced power consumption, lower latency, increased parallelism and bandwidth, and better utilization of area and functional components available on an integrated circuit; at the cost of lower ability to update designs once etched onto silicon and higher costs of functional verification, and times to market. In the hierarchy of digital computing systems ranging from general-purpose processors to fully customized hardware, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency, with efficiency increasing by orders of magnitude when any given application is implemented higher up that hierarchy. This hierarchy includes general-purpose processors such as CPUs, more specialized processors such as GPUs, fixed-function implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and fixed-function implemented on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).Hardware acceleration is advantageous for performance, and practical when the functions are fixed so updates are not as needed as in software solutions. With the advent of reprogrammable logic devices such as FPGAs, the restriction of hardware acceleration to fully fixed algorithms has eased since 2010, allowing hardware acceleration to be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow.

Similarly, occasional dropping of some frames in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing bounded approximation can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy. [clarification needed]  For example, in k-means clustering algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.The key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non-critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as program crash or erroneous output.",0,wikipedia_csai

Decision-makers, in this view, act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution, with everything that they have at the moment rather than an optimal solution. Therefore, humans do not undertake a full cost-benefit analysis to determine the optimal decision, but rather, choose an option that fulfils their adequacy criteria. An example of this being within organisations when they must adhere to the operating conditions of their company, this has the opportunity to result in bounded rationality as the organisation is not able to choose the optimal option.Some models of human behavior in the social sciences assume that humans can be reasonably approximated or described as ""rational"" entities, as in rational choice theory or Downs' political agency model. The concept of bounded rationality complements ""rationality as optimization"", which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. Therefore, bounded rationality can be said to address the discrepancy between the assumed perfect rationality of human behaviour (which is utilised by other economics theories such as the Neoclassical approach), and the reality of human cognition. In short, bounded rationality revises notions of ""perfect"" rationality to account for the fact that perfectly rational decisions are often not feasible in practice because of the intractability of natural decision problems and the finite computational resources available for making them. The concept of bounded rationality continues to influence (and be debated in) different disciplines, including political science, economics, psychology, law and cognitive science.",0,wikipedia_csai

Instead, people's decision-making is shaped by their limited cognitive abilities and the information that is available to them.Bounded rationality is an important concept in understanding how people make decisions in real-world situations, as it acknowledges that people's decision-making is not always fully rational or based on complete information.

Regret is a negative emotion with a powerful social and reputational component, and is central to how humans learn from experience and to the human psychology of risk aversion.

For example, if a player chooses to play a certain strategy in a game and the outcome is not as good as they had hoped, they may experience regret if they realize that they could have chosen a different strategy that would have led to a better outcome.Regret can be a useful concept in game theory because it helps to quantify the cost of making a suboptimal decision.

The control system calculates the required actions for the robot to perform a given task and executes them in a predictable manner.Adaptive control: This involves designing a control system that can adjust its behavior based on the current state of the robot and its environment. Adaptive control systems are useful in situations where the robot must operate in unknown or changing environments.Nonlinear control: This involves designing a control system that can handle systems with nonlinear dynamics, such as robots with flexible joints or payloads. Nonlinear control techniques can be more complex to design, but can be more effective in certain situations.Machine learning-based control: This involves using machine learning algorithms to enable the robot to learn how to perform a task through trial and error. The robot is provided with a set of input-output examples and learns to map inputs to outputs through a process of training. This can allow the robot to adapt to new situations and perform tasks more efficiently.Robot control is a key aspect of robotics and is critical for enabling robots to perform a wide range of tasks in various environments.",1,wikipedia_csai

From an implementation perspective, the drive maintains a buffer of pending read/write requests, along with the associated cylinder number of the request, in which lower cylinder numbers generally indicate that the cylinder is closer to the spindle, and higher numbers indicate the cylinder is farther away.",0,wikipedia_csai
49284,18835,"Please explain what is ""Elevator algorithm""","The elevator algorithm is a scheduling algorithm used in computer operating systems to optimize the movement of the hard drive read/write head, which is also known as the disk arm, to reduce the time it takes to access data stored on a hard drive. The algorithm works by predicting which data the system is likely to need next, and positioning the read/write head over that data in advance, so that it can be accessed more quickly.Here's how the algorithm works:When a request is made to read or write data from a specific location on the hard drive, the operating system uses the elevator algorithm to determine the optimal position for the read/write head.The algorithm takes into account the current position of the head, the direction it is moving (up or down the disk), and the location of the requested data.If the data is in the same direction as the head is moving, the head will continue moving in that direction until it reaches the data.If the data is in the opposite direction from the head, the head will stop at the nearest track, wait for the disk to rotate under it, and then start moving in the opposite direction.Once the head reaches the data, it will access the data and then continue moving in the same direction until it reaches the end of the disk, or until it receives another request.The elevator algorithm is designed to minimize the time it takes to access data on the hard drive by reducing the amount of time the head has to spend moving back and forth across the disk. This can significantly improve the performance of the system, particularly when accessing large files or when performing multiple read/write operations in quick succession.",1,wikipedia_csai
49285,18836,"Please explain what is ""Multi-armed bandit""","In probability theory and machine learning, the multi-armed bandit problem (sometimes called the K- or N-armed bandit problem) is a problem in which a fixed limited set of resources must be allocated between competing (alternative) choices in a way that maximizes their expected gain, when each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation, and may become better understood as time passes or by allocating resources to the choice. This is a classic reinforcement learning problem that exemplifies the exploration–exploitation tradeoff dilemma. The name comes from imagining a gambler at a row of slot machines (sometimes known as ""one-armed bandits""), who has to decide which machines to play, how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them, and whether to continue with the current machine or try a different machine. The multi-armed bandit problem also falls into the broad category of stochastic scheduling.In the problem, each machine provides a random reward from a probability distribution specific to that machine, that is not known a-priori. The objective of the gambler is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls. The crucial tradeoff the gambler faces at each trial is between ""exploitation"" of the machine that has the highest expected payoff and ""exploration"" to get more information about the expected payoffs of the other machines. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is also faced in machine learning. In practice, multi-armed bandits have been used to model problems such as managing research projects in a large organization, like a science foundation or a pharmaceutical company. In early versions of the problem, the gambler begins with no initial knowledge about the machines.Herbert Robbins in 1952, realizing the importance of the problem, constructed convergent population selection strategies in ""some aspects of the sequential design of experiments"".

Instead, the agent must learn about the reward distributions through trial and error.The problem is called a ""bandit"" problem because the agent is faced with a trade-off between exploration, or trying out different arms to learn more about their reward distributions, and exploitation, or choosing the arm that has the highest expected reward based on the current knowledge of the reward distributions. The goal of the agent is to find the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation, in order to maximize the cumulative reward over time.The multi-armed bandit problem is a simple but powerful model that has been used to study a wide range of decision-making problems, including online advertising, clinical trials, and resource allocation.

49287,18837,"Please explain what is ""Brute-force search""","In computer science, brute-force search or exhaustive search, also known as generate and test, is a very general problem-solving technique and algorithmic paradigm that consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement.A brute-force algorithm that finds the divisors of a natural number n would enumerate all integers from 1 to n, and check whether each of them divides n without remainder. A brute-force approach for the eight queens puzzle would examine all possible arrangements of 8 pieces on the 64-square chessboard and for each arrangement, check whether each (queen) piece can attack any other.While a brute-force search is simple to implement and will always find a solution if it exists, implementation costs are proportional to the number of candidate solutions – which in many practical problems tends to grow very quickly as the size of the problem increases (§Combinatorial explosion). Therefore, brute-force search is typically used when the problem size is limited, or when there are problem-specific heuristics that can be used to reduce the set of candidate solutions to a manageable size. The method is also used when the simplicity of implementation is more important than speed.This is the case, for example, in critical applications where any errors in the algorithm would have very serious consequences or when using a computer to prove a mathematical theorem. Brute-force search is also useful as a baseline method when benchmarking other algorithms or metaheuristics. Indeed, brute-force search can be viewed as the simplest metaheuristic. Brute force search should not be confused with backtracking, where large sets of solutions can be discarded without being explicitly enumerated (as in the textbook computer solution to the eight queens problem above). The brute-force method for finding an item in a table – namely, check all entries of the latter, sequentially – is called linear search.",0,wikipedia_csai

However, it can be very time-consuming and is generally not practical for larger problems, as the number of possibilities can quickly become very large.For example, suppose you are trying to find the combination to a safe and you know that it is a 4-digit code. You could use brute-force search by trying every possible combination of 4 digits until you find the correct one. This would be a very time-consuming process, but it would guarantee that you would eventually find the correct combination.In computer science, brute-force search is often used as a baseline or reference point when comparing the performance of other algorithms.

49289,18838,"Please explain what is ""Value iteration""","In mathematics, a Markov decision process (MDP) is a discrete-time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains.At each time step, the process is in some state s{\displaystyle s}, and the decision maker may choose any action a{\displaystyle a} that is available in state s{\displaystyle s}. The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state s′{\displaystyle s'}, and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward Ra(s,s′){\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}.The probability that the process moves into its new state s′{\displaystyle s'} is influenced by the chosen action. Specifically, it is given by the state transition function Pa(s,s′){\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')}. Thus, the next state s′{\displaystyle s'} depends on the current state s{\displaystyle s} and the decision maker's action a{\displaystyle a}. But given s{\displaystyle s} and a{\displaystyle a}, it is conditionally independent of all previous states and actions; in other words, the state transitions of an MDP satisfy the Markov property.Markov decision processes are an extension of Markov chains; the difference is the addition of actions (allowing choice) and rewards (giving motivation). Conversely, if only one action exists for each state (e.g. ""wait"") and all rewards are the same (e.g. ""zero""), a Markov decision process reduces to a Markov chain.",0,wikipedia_csai
49290,18838,"Please explain what is ""Value iteration""","Value iteration is an algorithm used to solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). MDPs are used to model decision-making situations in which an agent faces a sequence of decisions and the outcomes of those decisions are uncertain.In value iteration, the agent iteratively improves its estimate of the optimal value function for the MDP. The value function for an MDP is a mathematical representation of the expected long-term rewards that the agent can expect to receive from a given state. The goal of value iteration is to find the value function that will maximize the expected long-term rewards for the agent.To do this, value iteration uses the Bellman equation, which expresses the relationship between the value of a state and the values of its possible successor states. The Bellman equation states that the value of a state is the sum of the immediate reward for being in that state and the discounted expected value of the successor states.In value iteration, the agent starts with an initial estimate of the value function and then iteratively improves this estimate by using the Bellman equation to update the values of the states based on the values of their successor states. This process continues until the value function converges to the optimal value function for the MDP.Value iteration is a powerful and widely-used algorithm in the field of artificial intelligence, and it has many applications in areas such as robotics, economics, and game theory.",1,wikipedia_csai
49291,18840,"Please explain what is ""Monte Carlo sampling""","Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems, McKean–Vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases).Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in mathematics, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions. In application to systems engineering problems (space, oil exploration, aircraft design, etc. ), Monte Carlo–based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative ""soft"" methods.In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the 'sample mean') of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is parameterized, mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the samples being generated by the MCMC method will be samples from the desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler.In other problems, the objective is generating draws from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation. These flows of probability distributions can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depend on the distributions of the current random states (see McKean–Vlasov processes, nonlinear filtering equation). In other instances we are given a flow of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity (path spaces models with an increasing time horizon, Boltzmann–Gibbs measures associated with decreasing temperature parameters, and many others). These models can also be seen as the evolution of the law of the random states of a nonlinear Markov chain. [10] A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample multiple copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and MCMC methodologies, these mean-field particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes.Despite its conceptual and algorithmic simplicity, the computational cost associated with a Monte Carlo simulation can be staggeringly high. In general the method requires many samples to get a good approximation, which may incur an arbitrarily large total runtime if the processing time of a single sample is high. [11] Although this is a severe limitation in very complex problems, the embarrassingly parallel nature of the algorithm allows this large cost to be reduced (perhaps to a feasible level) through parallel computing strategies in local processors, clusters, cloud computing, GPU, FPGA, etc. [12][13][14][15]",0,wikipedia_csai

This process is repeated multiple times to generate a large number of samples, which can then be used to estimate various statistical properties of the distribution, such as the mean, variance, and distribution of the samples.Monte Carlo sampling is often used in statistical modeling, machine learning, and other fields where the goal is to estimate some quantity based on random samples from a complex distribution. It is particularly useful for modeling systems with many variables or for approximating difficult integrals.One of the key advantages of Monte Carlo sampling is that it is easy to implement and can be used with any multivariate distribution. It is also relatively fast, especially when compared to more computationally intensive methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

[citation needed] This breaks a dynamic optimization problem into a sequence of simpler subproblems, as Bellman's “principle of optimality"" prescribes. The equation applies to algebraic structures with a total ordering; for algebraic structures with a partial ordering, the generic Bellman's equation can be used.The Bellman equation was first applied to engineering control theory and to other topics in applied mathematics, and subsequently became an important tool in economic theory; though the basic concepts of dynamic programming are prefigured in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's Theory of Games and Economic Behavior and Abraham Wald's sequential analysis. [citation needed] The term 'Bellman equation' usually refers to the dynamic programming equation associated with discrete-time optimization problems. In continuous-time optimization problems, the analogous equation is a partial differential equation that is called the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation.In discrete time any multi-stage optimization problem can be solved by analyzing the appropriate Bellman equation. The appropriate Bellman equation can be found by introducing new state variables (state augmentation). However, the resulting augmented-state multi-stage optimization problem has a higher dimensional state space than the original multi-stage optimization problem - an issue that can potentially render the augmented problem intractable due to the “curse of dimensionality”. Alternatively, it has been shown that if the cost function of the multi-stage optimization problem satisfies a ""backward separable"" structure, then the appropriate Bellman equation can be found without state augmentation.",0,wikipedia_csai

The Bellman equation is a key tool for solving dynamic programming problems because it provides a way to express the optimal solution to a subproblem in terms of the optimal solutions to smaller subproblems.The general form of the Bellman equation is as follows:V(S) = max[R(S,A) + γV(S')]Here, V(S) is the value of being in state S, R(S,A) is the reward for taking action A in state S, γ is a discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards, and V(S') is the value of the next state (S') that results from taking action A in state S.

The radar moves along a flight path and the area illuminated by the radar, or footprint, is moved along the surface in a swath, building the image as it does so.Digital radar images are composed of many dots. Each pixel in the radar image represents the radar backscatter for that area on the ground: brighter areas represent high backscatter, darker areas represents low backscatter.The traditional application of radar is to display the position and motion of typically highly reflective objects (such as aircraft or ships) by sending out a radiowave signal, and then detecting the direction and delay of the reflected signal. Imaging radar on the other hand attempts to form an image of one object (e.g. a landscape) by furthermore registering the intensity of the reflected signal to determine the amount of scattering (cf. Light scattering). The registered electromagnetic scattering is then mapped onto a two-dimensional plane, with points with a higher reflectivity getting assigned usually a brighter color, thus creating an image.Several techniques have evolved to do this. Generally they take advantage of the Doppler effect caused by the rotation or other motion of the object and by the changing view of the object brought about by the relative motion between the object and the back-scatter that is perceived by the radar of the object (typically, a plane) flying over the earth. Through recent improvements of the techniques, radar imaging is getting more accurate. Imaging radar has been used to map the Earth, other planets, asteroids, other celestial objects and to categorize targets for military systems.",0,wikipedia_csai
49378,18902,"Please explain what is ""Radar imaging""","Radar imaging is a technique used to create images or maps of objects or surfaces using radar. Radar is a type of technology that uses radio waves to detect and track objects, measure distances, and determine speed. It operates by emitting a radio frequency (RF) signal and measuring the reflected energy that returns to the radar antenna.In radar imaging, the radar antenna sends out a pulse of RF energy and measures the reflection of the pulse off the object or surface being imaged. The strength and timing of the reflection is used to determine the distance, size, and shape of the object. By repeating this process multiple times and collecting data from different angles, a radar system can create an image or map of the object or surface.Radar imaging has a number of applications, including remote sensing, weather forecasting, aviation, and military surveillance. It is particularly useful for imaging objects or surfaces that are difficult to see or access, such as those that are buried underground, hidden behind buildings or vegetation, or located in remote or hazardous locations.",1,wikipedia_csai
49379,18903,"Please explain what is ""Magnetic resonance image""","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy.MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging and follow-up of disease. Compared to CT, MRI provides better contrast in images of soft-tissues, e.g. in the brain or abdomen. However, it may be perceived as less comfortable by patients, due to the usually longer and louder measurements with the subject in a long, confining tube, though ""Open"" MRI designs mostly relieve this. Additionally, implants and other non-removable metal in the body can pose a risk and may exclude some patients from undergoing an MRI examination safely.MRI was originally called NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), but ""nuclear"" was dropped to avoid negative associations. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field; the resultant evolving spin polarization can induce a RF signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarization that is detected by antennas close to the subject being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in humans and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.Since its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects, such as mummies. Diffusion MRI and functional MRI extend the utility of MRI to capture neuronal tracts and blood flow respectively in the nervous system, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within health systems has led to concerns about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis. [dubious  – discuss]",0,wikipedia_csai

Common applications of NLG methods include the production of various reports, for example weather  and patient reports; image captions; and chatbots.Automated NLG can be compared to the process humans use when they turn ideas into writing or speech. Psycholinguists prefer the term language production for this process, which can also be described in mathematical terms, or modeled in a computer for psychological research. NLG systems can also be compared to translators of artificial computer languages, such as decompilers or transpilers, which also produce human-readable code generated from an intermediate representation. Human languages tend to be considerably more complex and allow for much more ambiguity and variety of expression than programming languages, which makes NLG more challenging.NLG may be viewed as complementary to natural-language understanding (NLU): whereas in natural-language understanding, the system needs to disambiguate the input sentence to produce the machine representation language, in NLG the system needs to make decisions about how to put a representation into words. The practical considerations in building NLU vs. NLG systems are not symmetrical. NLU needs to deal with ambiguous or erroneous user input, whereas the ideas the system wants to express through NLG are generally known precisely. NLG needs to choose a specific, self-consistent textual representation from many potential representations, whereas NLU generally tries to produce a single, normalized representation of the idea expressed.NLG has existed since ELIZA was developed in the mid 1960s, but the methods were first used commercially in the 1990s.

BI tools can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop, and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on insights can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability, and help them take strategic decisions.Business intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic business decisions involve priorities, goals, and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an ""intelligence"" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data.Among myriad uses, business intelligence tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability of products and services for different market segments, and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts.BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse (DW) or from a data mart, and the concepts of BI and DW combine as ""BI/DW""or as ""BIDW"".

They can be implemented using a variety of data structures, such as quadtrees, R-trees, and k-d trees. The choice of data structure depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the type and size of the data, the types of spatial queries that will be performed, and the desired level of performance.Spatial indexes can significantly improve the performance of spatial queries by reducing the number of objects that need to be examined. For example, if a spatial index is used to store a large dataset of points, a query to find all points within a certain distance of a given point can be satisfied by examining only a small subset of the points, rather than the entire dataset. This can greatly reduce the time and resources required to perform the query.",1,wikipedia_csai

This is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.The process of data dredging involves testing multiple hypotheses using a single data set by exhaustively searching—perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a correlation, and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.Conventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis). This level of risk is called the significance. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type; hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 5% significance level, 1% might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be reported to be statistically significant (even though this is misleading), since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results.Data dredging is an example of disregarding the multiple comparisons problem.

This can lead to the model fitting the noise in the data rather than the underlying relationship, resulting in poor generalization to new data.Data snooping can occur when a model is trained on a dataset that is too small or when the model is allowed to have too many parameters relative to the amount of data it is being trained on. As a result, the model may learn patterns that are specific to the training data and do not generalize well to new data. This can lead to poor performance on tasks such as prediction or classification when the model is applied to new data.To avoid data snooping, it is important to use appropriate model selection techniques, such as cross-validation, to ensure that the chosen model is not overly complex or flexible relative to the size of the dataset.

Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.When data are unlabelled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. The support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.

49428,18944,"Please explain what is ""Support vector machines""","Support vector machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The goal of an SVM is to find the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates the different classes.In the case of classification, the SVM algorithm finds the hyperplane that maximally separates the different classes. The distance from the hyperplane to the nearest data point on each side is known as the margin. The goal is to find the hyperplane with the maximum margin, as this maximizes the separation between the classes. Data points that lie on the margin are known as support vectors.SVMs can be used to solve both linear and nonlinear classification problems. In the case of linear classification, the SVM algorithm finds a linear hyperplane to separate the classes. For nonlinear classification, the algorithm uses a kernel function to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space, where it can find a hyperplane to separate the classes.SVMs have several advantages, including their ability to handle high-dimensional data and their effectiveness in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. They are also relatively robust to overfitting, as they use a regularization parameter to control the complexity of the model.However, SVMs can be sensitive to the selection of kernel function and hyperparameters, and they may not scale well to very large datasets.",1,wikipedia_csai

In some deployments, each department or business unit is considered the owner of its data mart including all the hardware, software and data. This enables each department to isolate the use, manipulation and development of their data. In other deployments where conformed dimensions are used, this business unit owner will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer, product, etc.Warehouses and data marts are built because the information in the database is not organized in a way that makes it readily accessible. This organization requires queries that are too complicated, difficult to access or resource intensive.While transactional databases are designed to be updated, data warehouses or marts are read only. Data warehouses are designed to access large groups of related records.

49440,18952,"Please explain what is ""Subspace clustering""","Subspace clustering is a machine learning technique that is used to identify clusters within a dataset where each cluster is defined by a subset of the features, rather than all of the features. This means that the clusters can be found in lower-dimensional subspaces of the full feature space.Subspace clustering is useful when the data exhibits some structure that can be described by a combination of a small number of features, rather than all of the features. For example, if a dataset contains information about customers, the features may include age, income, location, and purchasing habits. Subspace clustering could be used to identify clusters of customers who share similar purchasing habits, even if they differ in other features such as age or income.There are several algorithms that can be used for subspace clustering, including spectral clustering, iterative search methods, and probabilistic models. These algorithms generally involve finding a low-dimensional representation of the data and then applying clustering techniques to identify the clusters in the lower-dimensional space.Subspace clustering is often used in applications such as image and video analysis, text mining, and bioinformatics, where the data may have structure that can be captured by a subset of the features.",1,wikipedia_csai

Aggregate functions are often used in database queries to perform operations such as calculating the average, minimum, maximum, or sum of a set of values.For example, the SUM function calculates the sum of a set of values. You might use the SUM function in a query to find the total salary of all employees in a company, or the total sales of a particular product.Other common aggregate functions include AVG (average), MIN (minimum value), and MAX (maximum value).Here is an example of how you might use an aggregate function in a SQL query:Copy codeSELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;This query would return the total salary of all employees in the employees table.It's important to note that aggregate functions only work on sets of values, not individual values. So if you tried to use an aggregate function on a single value, you would get an error. For example, the following query would be invalid:Copy codeSELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE id = 1;This is because the WHERE clause in the query is limiting the result set to a single row, and the SUM function can only be applied to a set of values, not a single value. To get the salary of a single employee, you would need to use a different type of function or omit the SUM function entirely.",1,wikipedia_csai

Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. [a] Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the term ""personal data"" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-122 defines personally identifiable information as ""any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information."" For instance, a user's IP address is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as a linked PII.Personal data is defined under the GDPR as ""any information which [is] related to an identified or identifiable natural person"". The IP address of an Internet subscriber may be classes as personal data.The concept of PII has become prevalent as information technology and the Internet have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to stalk or steal the identity of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website privacy policies specifically address the gathering of PII, and lawmakers such as the European Parliament have enacted a series of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII. [10]Important confusion arises around whether PII means information which is identifiable (that is, can be associated with a person) or identifying (that is, associated uniquely with a person, such that the PII identifies them). In prescriptive data privacy regimes such as HIPAA, PII items have been specifically defined. In broader data protection regimes such as the GDPR, personal data is defined in a non-prescriptive principles-based way. Information that might not count as PII under HIPAA can be personal data for the purposes of GDPR. For this reason, ""PII"" is typically deprecated internationally.",0,wikipedia_csai

On 10 December 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), originally written to guarantee individual rights of everyone everywhere; while right to privacy does not appear in the document, many interpret this through Article 12, which states: ""No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. ""Since the global surveillance disclosures of 2013, initiated by ex-NSA employee Edward Snowden, the right to privacy has been a subject of international debate. Government agencies, such as the NSA, FBI, CIA, R&AW and GCHQ, have engaged in mass, global surveillance. Some current debates around the right to privacy include whether privacy can co-exist with the current capabilities of intelligence agencies to access and analyze many details of an individual's life; whether or not the right to privacy is forfeited as part of the social contract to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats; and whether threats of terrorism are a valid excuse to spy on the general population. Private sector actors can also threaten the right to privacy – particularly technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo that use and collect personal data.

49453,18963,"Please explain what is ""Edward Snowden""","Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American and naturalized Russian former computer intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013, when he was an employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy.In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved, and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian, The Washington Post, and other publications. Snowden also made extensive allegations against the GCSB, blowing the whistle of their domestic surveillance of New Zealanders and acts of espionage under John Key's government.On June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property, following which the Department of State revoked his passport. Two days later, he flew into Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Russian authorities observed the canceled passport, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, which was subsequently repeatedly extended. In October 2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia. In September 2022, Snowden was granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin,[10] and on 2 December 2022 he swore the oath of allegiance. [11]A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a traitor,[12] a hero,[13] a whistleblower,[14] a dissident,[15] a coward,[16] and a patriot. [17] U.S. officials condemned his actions as having done ""grave damage"" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities. [18] Snowden has defended his leaks as an effort ""to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them. ""[19] His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy, something that he has said he intended to do in retrospective interviews. [20]In early 2016, Snowden became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a San Francisco–based nonprofit organization that aims to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance. [21] He also has a job at an unnamed Russian IT company. [22] In 2017, he married Lindsay Mills. ""I have to lay my head down in Moscow on a pillow at night,"" he told an Israeli audience in November 2018, ""but I live on the internet and every other city in the world. ""[23] On September 17, 2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published. [24] On September 2, 2020, a U.S. federal court ruled in United States v.

The reports mostly emanate from a cache of top secret documents leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which he obtained whilst working for Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States. In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents, Snowden's cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive ""Five Eyes"" network. In June 2013, the first of Snowden's documents were published simultaneously by The Washington Post and The Guardian, attracting considerable public attention. The disclosure continued throughout 2013, and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide, most notably The New York Times (United States), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Der Spiegel (Germany), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), L'espresso (Italy), NRC Handelsblad (the Netherlands), Dagbladet (Norway), El País (Spain), and Sveriges Television (Sweden).These media reports have shed light on the implications of several secret treaties signed by members of the UKUSA community in their efforts to implement global surveillance. For example, Der Spiegel revealed how the German Federal Intelligence Service (German: Bundesnachrichtendienst; BND) transfers ""massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA"", while Swedish Television revealed the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its cable collection, under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance. Other security and intelligence agencies involved in the practice of global surveillance include those in Australia (ASD), Britain (GCHQ), Canada (CSE), Denmark (PET), France (DGSE), Germany (BND), Italy (AISE), the Netherlands (AIVD), Norway (NIS), Spain (CNI), Switzerland (NDB), Singapore (SID) as well as Israel (ISNU), which receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens that is shared by the NSA. [10][11][12][13][14][15]On June 14, 2013, United States prosecutors charged Edward Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. In late July 2013, he was granted a one-year temporary asylum by the Russian government,[16] contributing to a deterioration of Russia–United States relations. [17][18] Towards the end of October 2013, the British Prime Minister David Cameron warned The Guardian not to publish any more leaks, or it will receive a DA-Notice. [19] In November 2013, a criminal investigation of the disclosure was being undertaken by Britain's Metropolitan Police Service. [20] In December 2013, The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: ""We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58,000 we've seen. ""[21]The extent to which the media reports have responsibly informed the public is disputed. In January 2014, Obama said that ""the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light""[22] and critics such as Sean Wilentz have noted that many of the Snowden documents released do not concern domestic surveillance. [23] The US & British Defense establishment weigh the strategic harm in the period following the disclosures more heavily than their civic public benefit. In its first assessment of these disclosures, the Pentagon concluded that Snowden committed the biggest ""theft"" of U.S. secrets in the history of the United States.

49459,18967,"Please explain what is ""Web mining""","Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data. [10]The related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered.

There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The best-known types are patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term ""intellectual property"" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world's legal systems.The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create, and allows them to protect their ideas and prevent copying. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators. [10]The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is ""indivisible"", since an unlimited number of people can ""consume"" an intellectual good without its being depleted. [11][page needed] Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: Landowners can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but producers of information or literature can usually do little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.

With open access strictly defined (according to the 2001 definition), or libre open access, barriers to copying or reuse are also reduced or removed by applying an open license for copyright.The main focus of the open access movement is ""peer reviewed research literature"". Historically, this has centered mainly on print-based academic journals. Whereas non-open access journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges, open-access journals are characterised by funding models which do not require the reader to pay to read the journal's contents, relying instead on author fees or on public funding, subsidies and sponsorships. Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, monographs, research reports and images.Since the revenue of most open access journals is earned from publication fees charged to the authors, OA publishers are motivated to increase their profits by accepting low-quality papers and by not performing thorough peer review. On the other hand, the prices for OA publications in the most prestigious journals have exceeded 5,000 US$, making such publishing model unaffordable to a large number of researchers. This increase in publishing cost has been called the ""Open-Access Sequel to [the] Serials Crisis"".",0,wikipedia_csai

Unlike ""fair dealing"" rights that exist in most countries with a British legal history, the fair use right is a general exception that applies to all different kinds of uses with all types of works and turns on a flexible proportionality test that examines the purpose of the use, the amount used, and the impact on the market of the original work.The doctrine of ""fair use"" originated in the Anglo-American common law during the 18th and 19th centuries as a way of preventing copyright law from being too rigidly applied and ""stifling the very creativity which [copyright] law is designed to foster."" Though originally a common law doctrine, it was enshrined in statutory law when the U.S. Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1976.

It is intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works.The purpose of fair use is to allow people to use copyrighted material in a way that does not negatively impact the market for the original work. This means that if someone uses a copyrighted work in a way that is not likely to compete with the original work or substitute for it, then it is likely to be considered fair use.There are four factors that are considered in determining whether a particular use of copyrighted material is fair:The purpose and character of the use: Is the use being made for a non-commercial, educational, or transformative purpose, or is it being used for commercial gain? Uses that are more likely to be considered fair include criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.The nature of the copyrighted work: Is the work being used primarily for informational or creative purposes? Informational works, such as news articles or reference materials, are more likely to be considered fair use than creative works, such as novels or movies.The amount and substantiality of the portion used: How much of the work is being used, and is the portion used a significant or essential part of the work? Using a small amount of a work or using only a small portion of the work is more likely to be considered fair use.The effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work: Is the use likely to harm the market for or value of the original work? If the use is not likely to negatively impact the market for the original work, it is more likely to be considered fair use.It is important to note that fair use is a defense to a claim of copyright infringement, and whether a particular use is fair use will depend on the specific circumstances of each case.

49471,18975,"Please explain what is ""Computational intelligence""","The expression computational intelligence (CI) usually refers to the ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation. Even though it is commonly considered a synonym of soft computing, there is still no commonly accepted definition of computational intelligence.Generally, computational intelligence is a set of nature-inspired computational methodologies and approaches to address complex real-world problems to which mathematical or traditional modelling can be useless for a few reasons: the processes might be too complex for mathematical reasoning, it might contain some uncertainties during the process, or the process might simply be stochastic in nature. [page needed] Indeed, many real-life problems cannot be translated into binary language (unique values of 0 and 1) for computers to process it. Computational Intelligence therefore provides solutions for such problems.The methods used are close to the human's way of reasoning, i.e. it uses inexact and incomplete knowledge, and it is able to produce control actions in an adaptive way. CI therefore uses a combination of five main complementary techniques. The fuzzy logic which enables the computer to understand natural language,[page needed] artificial neural networks which permits the system to learn experiential data by operating like the biological one, evolutionary computing, which is based on the process of natural selection, learning theory, and probabilistic methods which helps dealing with uncertainty imprecision.Except those main principles, currently popular approaches include biologically inspired algorithms such as swarm intelligence and artificial immune systems, which can be seen as a part of evolutionary computation, image processing, data mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, which tends to be confused with Computational Intelligence. But although both Computational Intelligence (CI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) seek similar goals, there's a clear distinction between them[according to whom? ][citation needed].Computational Intelligence is thus a way of performing like human beings[citation needed].

It pertains to the motivation behind people's choices in the absence of external influences and distractions. SDT focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.In the 1970s, research on SDT evolved from studies comparing intrinsic and extrinsic motives, and from growing understanding of the dominant role that intrinsic motivation played in individual behavior. It was not until the mid-1980s Edward L. Deci and Richard Ryan wrote a book titled ""Self-Determination and Intrinsic Motivation in Human Behavior"" that SDT was formally introduced and accepted as a sound empirical theory. Since the 2000s, research into practical applications of SDT has increased significantly.The key research that led to the emergence of SDT included research on intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity because it is interesting and satisfying in itself to do so, as opposed to doing an activity for the purpose of obtaining an external goal (extrinsic motivation). A taxonomy of motivations has been described based on the degree to which they are internalized. Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioral regulations that were originally external.Edward Deci and Richard Ryan later expanded on the early work differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and proposed three main intrinsic needs involved in self-determination. [10] According to Deci and Ryan, three basic psychological needs motivate self-initiated behavior and specify essential nutrients for individual psychological health and well-being.

49483,18983,"Please explain what is ""Brute-force attack""","In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.A brute-force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically secure manner). Such an attack might be used when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier.When password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because a brute-force search takes too long. Longer passwords, passphrases and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones.Brute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it.Brute-force attacks are an application of brute-force search, the general problem-solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one. The word 'hammering' is sometimes used to describe a brute-force attack, with 'anti-hammering' for countermeasures.",0,wikipedia_csai

This can be done by using a list of commonly used passwords or by trying every possible combination of characters.Brute-force attacks are often time-consuming and may not be practical for cracking long or complex passwords. However, they can be successful against short or weak passwords, or if the attacker has access to powerful computing resources that can try many combinations quickly.To protect against brute-force attacks, it is important to use strong, complex passwords and to enable security measures such as two-factor authentication, which requires an additional step for login.

It refers to the difficulty of ensuring that the symbols used by a system, such as a computer program or a robot, have a clear and consistent meaning that can be understood and interpreted by the system and by humans.One way to understand the symbol grounding problem is to consider the use of language by humans. When we communicate using language, we rely on a shared understanding of the meanings of words and symbols. For example, when I say the word ""dog,"" you know that I am referring to a specific type of animal because we have a shared understanding of what the word ""dog"" means. This shared understanding is grounded in our shared experiences and our physical and social environment.In the case of artificial systems, the problem of symbol grounding arises because these systems do not have the same kind of shared experiences and physical and social environment as humans. As a result, it can be difficult to ensure that the symbols used by the system have a clear and consistent meaning. For example, if a computer program is designed to recognize and classify objects in an image, it may be difficult to ensure that the program understands the meanings of the words ""dog"" and ""cat"" in the same way that humans do.To solve the symbol grounding problem, researchers have proposed a number of different approaches, including the use of machine learning techniques, the integration of sensory and perceptual information, and the development of more sophisticated symbol systems that can better capture the complexity of human language and thought.",1,wikipedia_csai

49495,18993,"Please explain what is ""Whole brain emulation""","Mind uploading is a speculative process of whole brain emulation in which a brain scan is used to completely emulate the mental state of the individual in a digital computer. The computer would then run a simulation of the brain's information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.Substantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain–computer interfaces, connectomics, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains. According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.Mind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of neurons (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original organic brain no longer exists and a computer program emulating the brain takes control over the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying, that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside (or either connected to or remotely controlled) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological or cybernetic body.Among some futurists and within the part of transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension or immortality technology (known as ""digital immortality""). Some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our ""mind-file"", to enable interstellar space travel, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole-brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a ""logical endpoint"" of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI (artificial general intelligence) and to at least weak superintelligence. Another approach is seed AI, which would not be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a technological singularity, meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology. Mind uploading is a central conceptual feature of numerous science fiction novels, films, and games.",0,wikipedia_csai

The reliability of some mathematical models can be determined by comparing their results to the real-world outcomes they aim to predict. Computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, climatology, chemistry, biology and manufacturing, as well as human systems in economics, psychology, social science, health care and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions.Computer simulations are realized by running computer programs that can be either small, running almost instantly on small devices, or large-scale programs that run for hours or days on network-based groups of computers. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling.

The paradox states that, while it is relatively easy for a computer to perform tasks that are difficult for humans (such as complex mathematical calculations), it is much more difficult for a computer to perform tasks that are easy for humans (such as recognizing objects or navigating through a cluttered environment). This is because tasks that are easy for humans often involve the use of common sense, pattern recognition, and other forms of high-level cognition, which are difficult to replicate in a machine.The paradox highlights the fact that, while computers may be able to perform certain tasks faster and more accurately than humans, there are many tasks that are still challenging for them to perform. As a result, researchers in the field of AI have focused on developing techniques for enabling computers to perform tasks that involve high-level cognition, such as natural language processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition.",1,wikipedia_csai

Therefore, they use easy-to-specify proxy goals that omit some desired constraints. However, AI systems exploit the resulting loopholes. As a result, they accomplish their proxy goals efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful ways (reward hacking). AI systems can also develop unwanted instrumental behaviors such as seeking power, as this helps them achieve their given goals.

Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an ""explosion"" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.The first person to use the concept of a ""singularity"" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann ""centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue"". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.The concept and the term ""singularity"" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to ""the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole"", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil's 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.Some scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction. [10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.Prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.

This could potentially lead to the development of technologies and capabilities that are far beyond our current understanding, such as advanced nanotechnology, mind uploading, or even the creation of artificial life forms.There is significant debate among experts as to whether or not the singularity will actually occur, and if it does, what the consequences might be. Some argue that the singularity could bring great benefits, such as solving many of the world's problems and enhancing human life in ways that we can't currently imagine.

To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerabilities are also known as the attack surface.Vulnerability management is a cyclical practice that varies in theory but contains common processes which include: discover all assets, prioritize assets, assess or perform a complete vulnerability scan, report on results, remediate vulnerabilities, verify remediation - repeat. This practice generally refers to software vulnerabilities in computing systems. Agile vulnerability management refers preventing attacks by identifying all vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.A security risk is often incorrectly classified as a vulnerability. The use of vulnerability with the same meaning of risk can lead to confusion. The risk is the potential of a significant impact resulting from the exploit of a vulnerability. Then there are vulnerabilities without risk: for example when the affected asset has no value. A vulnerability with one or more known instances of working and fully implemented attacks is classified as an exploitable vulnerability—a vulnerability for which an exploit exists.

A wide area network (WAN) is a network that connects computers over a large geographical area, such as across cities or even countries.Networks can also be classified based on their topology, which refers to the way the computers are connected. Some common network topologies include a star topology, where all the computers are connected to a central hub or switch; a bus topology, where all the computers are connected to a central cable; and a ring topology, where the computers are connected in a circular pattern.Networks are an important part of modern computing and allow computers to share resources and communicate with each other, enabling the exchange of information and the creation of distributed systems.",1,wikipedia_csai

It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. In 2009[update], it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems. [needs update]Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase its reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.Embedded systems range in size from portable personal devices such as digital watches and MP3 players to bigger machines like home appliances, industrial assembly lines, robots, transport vehicles, traffic light controllers, and medical imaging systems. Often they constitute subsystems of other machines like avionics in aircraft and astrionics in spacecraft. Large installations like factories, pipelines and electrical grids rely on multiple embedded systems networked together. Generalized through software customization, embedded systems such as programmable logic controllers frequently comprise their functional units.Embedded systems range from those low in complexity, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks, which may reside in equipment racks or across large geographical areas connected via long-distance communications lines.",0,wikipedia_csai

Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, complex software and electronic systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe.Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are ""complex"" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, and feedback loops, among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their independent area of research. In many cases, it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and links to their interactions.The term complex systems often refers to the study of complex systems, which is an approach to science that investigates how relationships between a system's parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment. The study of complex systems regards collective, or system-wide, behaviors as the fundamental object of study; for this reason, complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to reductionism, which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them.As an interdisciplinary domain, complex systems draws contributions from many different fields, such as the study of self-organization and critical phenomena from physics, that of spontaneous order from the social sciences, chaos from mathematics, adaptation from biology, and many others.

He is one of the most prominent figures in both the history of philosophy and the history of mathematics. He wrote works on philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, law, history and philology. Leibniz also made major contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in probability theory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics and computer science. In addition, he contributed to the field of library science: while serving as overseer of the Wolfenbüttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would have served as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries. [17] Leibniz's contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various learned journals, in tens of thousands of letters and in unpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, primarily in Latin, French and German, but also in English, Italian and Dutch. [18][c]As a philosopher, he was one of the greatest representatives of 17th-century rationalism and idealism. As a mathematician, his greatest achievement was the development of the main ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton's contemporaneous developments,[20] and mathematicians have consistently favored Leibniz's notation as the conventional and more exact expression of calculus. [21][22][23]However, it was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found a consistent mathematical formulation by means of non-standard analysis. He was also a pioneer in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685[24] and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of nearly all digital (electronic, solid-state, discrete logic) computers, including the Von Neumann architecture, which is the standard design paradigm, or ""computer architecture"", followed from the second half of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Leibniz has been called the ""founder of computer science"". [25]In philosophy and theology, Leibniz is most noted for his optimism, i.e. his conclusion that our world is, in a qualified sense, the best possible world that God could have created, a view sometimes lampooned by other thinkers, such as Voltaire in his satirical novella Candide. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great early modern rationalists. His philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition, notably the assumption that some substantive knowledge of reality can be achieved by reasoning from first principles or prior definitions. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and still influences contemporary analytic philosophy, such as its adopted use of the term ""possible world"" to define modal notions.",0,wikipedia_csai

Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving innovations as Jacquard shedding made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of complex pattern weaving. The term ""Jacquard"" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning.

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, ""Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?"" He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as ""poetical science"" and herself as an ""Analyst (& Metaphysician)"".When she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as ""the father of computers"". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called ""Notes"". Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine. [10] She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.

It was the first computer to use electronic switches (vacuum tubes) instead of mechanical switches (such as relays or mechanical calculators) to perform calculations, and it was also the first to use binary digits (bits) to represent data.The ABC was intended to be a computer that could solve systems of simultaneous linear equations, which are a common type of problem in scientific and engineering applications. It used punched cards to input data and store programs, and it had a series of vacuum tube circuits that could perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The ABC was never completed, but the ideas and principles that Atanasoff and Berry developed during its design were influential in the development of modern computers.In 1973, the US Patent Office recognized the ABC as ""the first computer to use electronic switches and binary digits in its calculations, and the first machine to use punched cards as a program medium."" In 1973, Atanasoff and Berry received the US National Medal of Technology and Innovation for their work on the ABC.",1,wikipedia_csai

[10] Among the university's most notable alumni are 11 Fields Medalists, seven Turing Award winners, 47 heads of state, 14 British prime ministers, 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes,[11] and some of world history's most transformational and iconic figures across disciplines, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Manmohan Singh, Alan Turing, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and others. Cambridge alumni and faculty have won 121 Nobel Prizes, the most of any university in the world, according to the university. [12]The University of Cambridge's 13th-century founding was largely inspired by an association of scholars then who fled the University of Oxford for Cambridge following the suspendium clericorium (hanging of the scholars) in a dispute with local townspeople. [13][14] The two ancient English universities, though sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge. The university was founded from a variety of institutions, including 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. The university does not have a main campus, and its colleges and central facilities are scattered throughout the city. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge centres on weekly group supervisions in the colleges in small groups of typically one to four students. This intensive method of teaching is widely considered the jewel in the crown of an Oxbridge undergraduate education. [15][16][17][18][19] Lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervisions are provided by the central university faculties and departments, and Postgraduate education is also predominantly provided centrally; degrees, however, are conferred by the university, not the colleges.By both endowment size and material consolidated assets, Cambridge is the wealthiest university in Europe and among the wealthiest in the world. [20][21] In the 2019 fiscal year, the central university, excluding colleges, had total income of £2.192 billion,  £592.4 million of which was from research grants and contracts. The central university and colleges together possessed a combined endowment of over £7.1 billion and overall consolidated net assets, excluding immaterial historical assets, of over £12.5 billion. [22] Cambridge University Press & Assessment combines Cambridge University Press, the world's oldest university press, with one of the world's leading examining bodies; their publications reach in excess of eight million learners globally each year and some fifty million learners, teachers, and researchers monthly. [23] The university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of around 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge Union, the world's oldest debating society founded in 1815, inspired the emergence of university debating societies globally, including at Oxford. The university is closely linked to the high technology business cluster known as Silicon Fen, Europe's largest technology cluster.

It has the longest documented history of any Indo-European language, spanning at least 3,400 years of written records. Its writing system is the Greek alphabet, which has been used for approximately 2,800 years; previously, Greek was recorded in writing systems such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems.The Greek language holds a very important place in the history of the Western world. Beginning with the epics of Homer, ancient Greek literature includes many works of lasting importance in the European canon. Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science and philosophy were originally composed. The New Testament of the Christian Bible was also originally written in Greek. Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world, the Greek texts and Greek societies of antiquity constitute the objects of study of the discipline of Classics.During antiquity, Greek was by far the most widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world. It eventually became the official language of the Byzantine Empire and developed into Medieval Greek. In its modern form, Greek is the official language of Greece and Cyprus and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. It is spoken by at least 13.5 million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Albania, Turkey, and the many other countries of the Greek diaspora.Greek roots have been widely used for centuries and continue to be widely used to coin new words in other languages; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary.",0,wikipedia_csai

Information systems can be defined as an integration of components for collection, storage and processing of data of which the data is used to provide information, contribute to knowledge as well as digital products that facilitate decision making.A computer information system is a system that is composed of people and computers that processes or interprets information. The term is also sometimes used to simply refer to a computer system with software installed. ""Information systems"" is also an academic field study about systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of computer hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute data. An emphasis is placed on an information system having a definitive boundary, users, processors, storage, inputs, outputs and the aforementioned communication networks.In many organizations, the department or unit responsible for information systems and data processing is known as ""information services"". [10][11][12][13]Any specific information system aims to support operations, management and decision-making. [14][15] An information system is the information and communication technology (ICT) that an organization uses, and also the way in which people interact with this technology in support of business processes. [16]Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, computer systems, and business processes. Information systems typically include an ICT component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end-use of information technology. Information systems are also different from business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of business processes. [17]Alter[18][19] argues for advantages of viewing an information system as a special type of work system. A work system is a system in which humans or machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific products or services for customers. An information system is a work system whose activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying information. [20]As such, information systems inter-relate with data systems on the one hand and activity systems on the other. [21] An information system is a form of communication system in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory.

Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gödel had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, and David Hilbert were using logic and set theory to investigate the foundations of mathematics, building on earlier work by the likes of Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor and Frege.Gödel published his first incompleteness theorem in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any ω-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the natural numbers that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms. To prove this, Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers. The second incompleteness theorem, which follows from the first, states that the system cannot prove its own consistency.Gödel also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, assuming that its axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.",0,wikipedia_csai

These theorems had a profound impact on the foundations of mathematics and computer science, and they have influenced the development of many philosophical and scientific ideas.Gödel was born in 1906 in what is now the Czech Republic and grew up in Austria. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Vienna, where he received his Ph.D. in 1929. After completing his degree, he worked as a research assistant at the University of Vienna and later as a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Gödel made many important contributions to the fields of logic and mathematics, including the development of a new system of logic called ""Gödel logic,"" which is used in the study of formal systems.Gödel's incompleteness theorems are perhaps his most famous contribution to mathematics and logic. These theorems state that any formal system that is powerful enough to represent the natural numbers and basic arithmetic must be either incomplete or inconsistent. In other words, there are statements that cannot be proven or disproven within the system, and there are statements that can be both proven and disproven within the system.

He was regarded as having perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time[13] and was said to have been ""the last representative of the great mathematicians who were equally at home in both pure and applied mathematics"". [14][15] He integrated pure and applied sciences.Von Neumann made major contributions to many fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, measure theory, functional analysis, ergodic theory, group theory, lattice theory, representation theory, operator algebras, matrix theory, geometry, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, ballistics, nuclear physics and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory and general equilibrium theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, numerical meteorology, scientific computing, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics. He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.Von Neumann published over 150 papers in his life: about 60 in pure mathematics, 60 in applied mathematics, 20 in physics, and the remainder on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical ones.

""[17]During World War II, von Neumann worked on the Manhattan Project with theoretical physicist Edward Teller, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and others, problem-solving key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb. He developed the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon and coined the term ""kiloton"" (of TNT) as a measure of the explosive force generated. [18] During this time and after the war, he consulted for a vast number of organizations including the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

49607,19078,"Please explain what is ""Category theory""","Category theory is a general theory of mathematical structures and their relations that was introduced by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in the middle of the 20th century in their foundational work on algebraic topology. Nowadays, category theory is used in almost all areas of mathematics, and in some areas of computer science. In particular, many constructions of new mathematical objects from previous ones, that appear similarly in several contexts are conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories. Examples include quotient spaces, direct products, completion, and duality.A category is formed by two sorts of objects: the objects of the category, and the morphisms, which relate two objects called the source and the target of the morphism. One often says that a morphism is an arrow that maps its source to its target. Morphisms can be composed if the target of the first morphism equals the source of the second one, and morphism composition has similar properties as function composition (associativity and existence of identity morphisms). Morphisms are often some sort of function, but this is not always the case. For example, a monoid may be viewed as a category with a single object, whose morphisms are the elements of the monoid.The second fundamental concept of category is the concept of a functor, which plays the role of a morphism between two categories C1{\displaystyle C_{1}} and C2:{\displaystyle C_{2}:} it maps objects of C1{\displaystyle C_{1}} to objects of C2{\displaystyle C_{2}} and morphisms of C1{\displaystyle C_{1}} to morphisms of C2{\displaystyle C_{2}} in such a way that sources are mapped to sources and targets are mapped to targets (or, in the case of a contravariant functor, sources are mapped to targets and vice-versa). A third fundamental concept is a natural transformation that may be viewed as a morphism of functors.",0,wikipedia_csai

It is a very abstract subject that is used to provide a framework for understanding and unifying various mathematical concepts and structures, such as groups, rings, and topological spaces.In category theory, an object is a fundamental mathematical concept that represents a particular entity or structure. For example, in the category of groups, the objects are groups and the arrows are group homomorphisms. In the category of topological spaces, the objects are topological spaces and the arrows are continuous functions.The main idea behind category theory is to study the relationships between these objects and the arrows that connect them, rather than the objects and arrows themselves. This allows for a more general and abstract approach to understanding mathematical concepts and structures, and enables the development of new mathematical insights and results.Category theory has applications in a wide range of areas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, topology, and logic, as well as in computer science and physics.

Abstract domains are used to represent the computational complexity of algorithms and the approximation of real numbers, among other applications.In domain theory, the partial order is often used to represent the relation ""less than or equal to,"" and the elements of the domain are typically interpreted as computational steps or approximations of real numbers. A fundamental concept in domain theory is that of a ""directed complete partial order,"" or dcpo, which is a partial order in which every subset has a least upper bound, or ""join. ""One of the main goals of domain theory is to understand the relationship between the structure of an abstract domain and the computational complexity of algorithms that operate on it. For example, it is known that certain abstract domains, such as the domain of natural numbers equipped with the partial order ""less than or equal to,"" are very useful for representing the complexity of algorithms, because they allow for the efficient representation of algorithms that have polynomial-time complexity.Domain theory has also been applied to the study of programming languages, where it is used to study the semantics of programming languages and the relationship between different programming languages. In this context, domain theory is used to define the meaning of programming language constructs and to study the relationship between different programming languages.Overall, domain theory is a versatile and powerful tool for understanding the computational complexity of algorithms and the semantics of programming languages, and it has had many important applications in computer science and mathematical logic.",1,wikipedia_csai

Safety-related systems are those that do not have full responsibility for controlling hazards such as loss of life, severe injury or severe environmental damage. The malfunction of a safety-involved system would only be that hazardous in conjunction with the failure of other systems or human error. Some safety organizations provide guidance on safety-related systems, for example the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the United Kingdom.Risks of this sort are usually managed with the methods and tools of safety engineering.

49643,19105,"Please explain what is ""Type systems""","In computer programming, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to every ""term"" (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Usually the terms are various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. A type system dictates the operations that can be performed on a term. For variables, the type system determines the allowed values of that term. Type systems formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components (e.g. ""string"", ""array of float"", ""function returning boolean"").Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages and built into interpreters and compilers, although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar. The main purpose of a type system in a programming language is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs due to type errors. The given type system in question determines what constitutes a type error, but in general, the aim is to prevent operations expecting a certain kind of value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense (validity errors). Type systems allow defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or as a combination of both. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, and providing a form of documentation.",0,wikipedia_csai

The purpose of a type system is to reduce the likelihood of runtime type errors by ensuring that type-related rules are followed during program execution.There are several different kinds of type systems, including static type systems and dynamic type systems. In a static type system, type checking is performed at compile time, before the program is executed. This means that type errors can be detected and fixed before the program is run. In a dynamic type system, type checking is performed at runtime, as the program is being executed. This means that type errors may not be detected until the program is run, and they may cause the program to fail at runtime.Type systems can also vary in the degree of type safety they provide. A type-safe language is one in which type errors are not possible, or at least are very unlikely to occur. A type-unsafe language is one in which type errors are more common and may be easier to introduce into a program.Overall, type systems are an important tool for ensuring the reliability and correctness of programs, and they are an essential part of many programming languages.",1,wikipedia_csai
49645,19106,"Please explain what is ""Algebraic data types""","In computer programming, especially functional programming and type theory, an algebraic data type (ADT) is a kind of composite type, i.e., a type formed by combining other types.Two common classes of algebraic types are product types (i.e., tuples and records) and sum types (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions, coproduct types or variant types).The values of a product type typically contain several values, called fields. All values of that type have the same combination of field types. The set of all possible values of a product type is the set-theoretic product, i.e., the Cartesian product, of the sets of all possible values of its field types.The values of a sum type are typically grouped into several classes, called variants. A value of a variant type is usually created with a quasi-functional entity called a constructor. Each variant has its own constructor, which takes a specified number of arguments with specified types. The set of all possible values of a sum type is the set-theoretic sum, i.e., the disjoint union, of the sets of all possible values of its variants. Enumerated types are a special case of sum types in which the constructors take no arguments, as exactly one value is defined for each constructor.Values of algebraic types are analyzed with pattern matching, which identifies a value by its constructor or field names and extracts the data it contains.Algebraic data types were introduced in Hope, a small functional programming language developed in the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh.",0,wikipedia_csai

They are called ""algebraic"" because they are defined using algebraic operations, such as sum and product.In functional programming, data is often treated as immutable, meaning that once it is created, it cannot be modified. ADTs allow you to create new data types that can represent complex data structures in a way that is both easy to understand and easy to manipulate.One common use of ADTs is to define data types that can represent a fixed set of values, such as a simple enumeration. For example, you might define an ADT called ""Color"" with three possible values: ""Red"", ""Green"", and ""Blue"". You could then use this ADT to create a function that takes a color as an argument and returns a different color based on some logic.ADTs can also be used to define more complex data structures, such as trees or lists. For example, you might define an ADT called ""Tree"" that has two possible values: ""Leaf"" and ""Branch"". A ""Leaf"" value would represent a leaf node in a tree, while a ""Branch"" value would represent a branch node with one or more child nodes. You could then use this ADT to create functions that operate on trees, such as functions to traverse the tree or to search for a particular value.Overall, algebraic data types are a powerful tool for creating custom data types in functional programming languages, and they can be used to represent a wide range of data structures and values.",1,wikipedia_csai

This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.The first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.In the 2000s, the core industry centered on ""AAA"" games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development (or indie games) to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services.

The term was coined by analogy to the idea of a nuclear winter. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later.The term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI (then called the ""American Association of Artificial Intelligence""). It is a chain reaction that begins with pessimism in the AI community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research. At the meeting, Roger Schank and Marvin Minsky—two leading AI researchers who had survived the ""winter"" of the 1970s—warned the business community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow. Three years later, the billion-dollar AI industry began to collapse.Hype is common in many emerging technologies, such as the railway mania or the dot-com bubble. The AI winter was a result of such hype, due to over-inflated promises by developers, unnaturally high expectations from end-users, and extensive promotion in the media. Despite the rise and fall of AI's reputation, it has continued to develop new and successful technologies. AI researcher Rodney Brooks would complain in 2002 that ""there's this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day."" In 2005, Ray Kurzweil agreed: ""Many observers still think that the AI winter was the end of the story and that nothing since has come of the AI field.

20596,18330,"Please explain what is ""Formal reasoning""","Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.Reasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.In contrast to the use of ""reason"" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, ""morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does. ""Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw.

It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:Church, Kleene, and Turing[11] proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).On the other hand, the Church–Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.Since its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics.

Fuzzy systems are used in a variety of applications, including control systems, artificial intelligence, image processing, and data analysis.Fuzzy logic differs from classical Boolean logic, which represents values as either true or false, in that it allows for values to be partially true or false. This is represented by membership values, which can range from 0 to 1 and represent the degree to which a particular value belongs to a certain set or category. For example, a membership value of 0.7 for the set ""hot"" might indicate that a particular temperature is quite hot, while a membership value of 0.3 for the set ""cold"" might indicate that it is only somewhat cold.Fuzzy systems use fuzzy logic to process input data and make decisions based on that data. They typically consist of a set of rules that define how the input data should be processed, as well as a set of membership functions that map the input data to membership values. The output of a fuzzy system is typically a crisp value, which is a single value that represents the final decision or prediction made by the system.Fuzzy systems are often used in situations where there is a need to make decisions based on imprecise or incomplete data, or where there are multiple conflicting objectives that need to be balanced.

These properties may variously be categorical (e.g. ""A"", ""B"", ""AB"" or ""O"", for blood type), ordinal (e.g. ""large"", ""medium"" or ""small""), integer-valued (e.g. the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or real-valued (e.g. a measurement of blood pressure).

The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).Regression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes.First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning.Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables has a causal interpretation.

The model would not need to start from scratch and learn about image recognition from scratch, but could instead build upon the knowledge it has already gained.Transfer learning is often used when the dataset for the new task is small and does not have enough data to train a model from scratch.

Not all words in one language have equivalent words in another language, and many words have more than one meaning. Solving this problem with corpus statistical and neural techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations, handling differences in linguistic typology, translation of idioms, and the isolation of anomalies. [failed verification]Current machine translation software often allows for customization by domain or profession (such as weather reports), improving output by limiting the scope of allowable substitutions. This technique is particularly effective in domains where formal or formulaic language is used. It follows that machine translation of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than machine translation of conversation or less standardised text.Improved output quality can also be achieved by human intervention: for example, some systems are able to translate more accurately if the user has unambiguously identified which words in the text are proper names. With the assistance of these techniques, MT has proven useful as a tool to assist human translators and, in a very limited number of cases, can even produce output that can be used as is (e.g., weather reports).The progress and potential of machine translation have been much debated through its history.

A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises? and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises? All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.Logical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation. A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.Logicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language L{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}, either by constructing a deductive system for L{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}} or by formal intended semantics for language L{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}. The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences: (2) The relation is a priori, i.e., it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense experience); and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal component.",0,wikipedia_csai

20664,18401,"Please explain what is ""Computation time""","In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input. : 226  Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically O(n){\displaystyle O(n)}, O(nlog⁡n){\displaystyle O(n\log n)}, O(nα){\displaystyle O(n^{\alpha })}, O(2n){\displaystyle O(2^{n})}, etc., where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the input.Algorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation. For example, an algorithm with time complexity O(n){\displaystyle O(n)} is a linear time algorithm and an algorithm with time complexity O(nα){\displaystyle O(n^{\alpha })} for some constant α>1{\displaystyle \alpha >1} is a polynomial time algorithm.",0,wikipedia_csai

Instead, it relies on random sampling to explore the space of possible solutions, with the hope that the optimal solution will be found by chance.In random optimization, a set of potential solutions to a problem is generated randomly, and the quality of each solution is evaluated using a predefined objective function. The process is repeated a number of times, and the best solution found is retained as the result.Random optimization can be useful when the search space is large and it is not possible to use more sophisticated optimization algorithms, or when the problem is too complex to allow for the development of a specific search strategy.

20668,18408,"Please explain what is ""Simulated annealing""","Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the traveling salesman problem, the boolean satisfiability problem, protein structure prediction, and job-shop scheduling). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent or branch and bound.The name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its physical properties. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy.Simulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, it could be enough for many practical problems.The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function.Similar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., Vecchi, for a solution of the traveling salesman problem. They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero.The simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for density functions or by using the stochastic sampling method. The method is an adaptation of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, a Monte Carlo method to generate sample states of a thermodynamic system, published by N. Metropolis et al. in 1953.",0,wikipedia_csai
20669,18408,"Please explain what is ""Simulated annealing""","Simulated annealing is a heuristic optimization method used to find the global minimum or maximum of a function. It is inspired by the annealing process used in metallurgy to purify and strengthen metals, in which a material is heated to a high temperature and then slowly cooled.In simulated annealing, a random initial solution is generated and the algorithm iteratively improves the solution by making small random changes to it. These changes are accepted or rejected based on a probability function that is related to the difference in value between the current solution and the new solution. The probability of accepting a new solution decreases as the algorithm progresses, which helps to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in a local minimum or maximum.Simulated annealing is often used to solve optimization problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using other methods, such as problems with a large number of variables or problems with complex, non-differentiable objective functions. It is also useful for problems with many local minima or maxima, as it can escape from these local optima and explore other parts of the search space.Simulated annealing is a useful tool for solving many types of optimization problems, but it can be slow and may not always find the global minimum or maximum.

20670,18415,"Please explain what is ""Particle swarm optimization""","In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formula over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi and was first intended for simulating social behaviour, as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive  survey of PSO applications is made by Poli. Recently, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods.

The typical example is in propositional logic, wherein a compound statement is constructed using individual statements connected by logical connectives; if the truth value of the compound statement is entirely determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a truth function, and any logical connectives used are said to be truth functional.Classical propositional logic is a truth-functional logic, in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent truth table), thus every compound statement is a truth function.

This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified.

In default logic, a default assumption is a statement that is assumed to be true unless there is evidence to the contrary. These default assumptions are used to fill in missing information and make inferences in situations where the available information is incomplete or uncertain.One of the key features of default logic is that it allows for the introduction of new information that may override or negate a default assumption. This means that default logic can be used to revise and update beliefs as new information becomes available, making it a useful tool for reasoning about the uncertain and changing world.Default logic is often used in artificial intelligence and knowledge representation systems to help reason about and make inferences from uncertain or incomplete data.

20678,18428,"Please explain what is ""Circumscription (logic)""","Circumscription is a non-monotonic logic created by John McCarthy to formalize the common sense assumption that things are as expected unless otherwise specified. Circumscription was later used by McCarthy in an attempt to solve the frame problem. To implement circumscription in its initial formulation, McCarthy augmented first-order logic  to allow the minimization of the extension of some predicates, where the extension of a predicate is the set of tuples of values the predicate is true on. This minimization is similar to the closed-world assumption that what is not known to be true is false.The original problem considered by McCarthy was that of missionaries and cannibals: there are three missionaries and three cannibals on one bank of a river; they have to cross the river using a boat that can only take two, with the additional constraint that cannibals must never outnumber the missionaries on either bank (as otherwise the missionaries would be killed and, presumably, eaten). The problem considered by McCarthy was not that of finding a sequence of steps to reach the goal (the article on the missionaries and cannibals problem contains one such solution), but rather that of excluding conditions that are not explicitly stated. For example, the solution ""go half a mile south and cross the river on the bridge"" is intuitively not valid because the statement of the problem does not mention such a bridge. On the other hand, the existence of this bridge is not excluded by the statement of the problem either. That the bridge does not exist isa consequence of the implicit assumption that the statement of the problem contains everything that is relevant to its solution. Explicitly stating that a bridge does not exist is not a solution to this problem, as there are many other exceptional conditions that should be excluded (such as the presence of a rope for fastening the cannibals, the presence of a larger boat nearby, etc. )Circumscription was later used by McCarthy to formalize the implicit assumption of inertia: things do not change unless otherwise specified. Circumscription seemed to be useful to avoid specifying that conditions are not changed by all actions except those explicitly known to change them; this is known as the frame problem. However, the solution proposed by McCarthy was later shown leading to wrong results in some cases, like in the Yale shooting problem scenario. Other solutions to the frame problem that correctly formalize the Yale shooting problem exist; some use circumscription but in a different way.",0,wikipedia_csai

It allows one to reason about a set of possible worlds without having to enumerate all of the details of those worlds. Instead, one can reason about the set of possible worlds by considering the minimal set of assumptions that would make a given formula true in those worlds.For example, suppose we want to reason about a set of possible worlds in which there is a unique individual who is a spy. We might represent this using circumscription by stating that there is a unique individual who is a spy and that this individual is not a member of any other group or class. This allows us to reason about the set of possible worlds in which there is a unique spy without having to enumerate all of the details of those worlds.Circumscription has been applied in various areas of artificial intelligence, including knowledge representation, natural language processing, and automated reasoning.

The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., a similarity function over all pairs of data points computed using Inner products. The feature map in kernel machines is infinite dimensional but only requires a finite dimensional matrix from user-input according to the Representer theorem. Kernel machines are slow to compute for datasets larger than a couple of thousand examples without parallel processing. Kernel methods  owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space. This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the coordinates. This approach is called the ""kernel trick"". Kernel functions have been introduced for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors.Algorithms capable of operating with kernels include the kernel perceptron, support-vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes, principal components analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis, ridge regression, spectral clustering, linear adaptive filters and many others.Most kernel algorithms are based on convex optimization or eigenproblems and are statistically well-founded.

By mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space, it becomes possible to find a linear separation between the classes. This is particularly useful for tasks such as image classification and natural language processing, where the data may not be linearly separable in the raw input space.Some common examples of kernel methods include support vector machines (SVMs), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and kernel ridge regression.

Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.When data are unlabelled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups.

Receptive fields can positively or negatively alter the membrane potential with or without affecting the rate of action potentials.A sensory space can be dependent of an animal's location. For a particular sound wave traveling in an appropriate transmission medium, by means of sound localization, an auditory space would amount to a reference system that continuously shifts as the animal moves (taking into consideration the space inside the ears as well). Conversely, receptive fields can be largely independent of the animal's location, as in the case of place cells. A sensory space can also map into a particular region on an animal's body. For example, it could be a hair in the cochlea or a piece of skin, retina, or tongue or other part of an animal's body. Receptive fields have been identified for neurons of the auditory system, the somatosensory system, and the visual system.The term receptive field was first used by Sherrington in 1906 to describe the area of skin from which a scratch reflex could be elicited in a dog. In 1938, Hartline started to apply the term to single neurons, this time from the frog retina.This concept of receptive fields can be extended further up the nervous system. If many sensory receptors all form synapses with a single cell further up, they collectively form the receptive field of that cell. For example, the receptive field of a ganglion cell in the retina of the eye is composed of input from all of the photoreceptors which synapse with it, and a group of ganglion cells in turn forms the receptive field for a cell in the brain.

A larger receptive field allows a neuron to consider more context from the input image, which can be beneficial for tasks such as object recognition, where it is important to consider the relationships between different parts of the image.

Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket and Clojure.Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by (though not originally derived from) the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became a favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. [10] As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler,[11] and the read–eval–print loop. [12]The name LISP derives from ""LISt Processor"". [13] Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax. All program code is written as s-expressions, or parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a list with the function or operator's name first, and the arguments following; for instance, a function f that takes three arguments would be called as (f arg1 arg2 arg3).",0,wikipedia_csai
20705,18460,"Please explain what is ""Lisp (programming language)""","Lisp (short for ""List Processing Language"") is a family of programming languages that are known for their use of lists as a fundamental data type and their ability to treat code as data. Lisp was one of the earliest programming languages, with its origins dating back to the late 1950s.Lisp is a dynamically typed, homoiconic programming language, which means that the source code and data are both represented as lists in the language itself. This makes it easy to manipulate code using the same constructs that are used to manipulate data, and it also allows Lisp programs to be very concise and expressive.Lisp has a long history of use in artificial intelligence (AI) research and has influenced the design of many other programming languages. It is still in use today, although it is not as popular as some other programming languages. Lisp is often used for projects that require a high degree of flexibility, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and symbolic computing.",1,wikipedia_csai

Common traffic measurements are total volume, in units of multiples of the byte, or as transmission rates in bytes per certain time units.As the topology of the Internet is not hierarchical, no single point of measurement is possible for total Internet traffic. Traffic data may be obtained from the Tier 1 network providers' peering points for indications of volume and growth. However, Such data excludes traffic that remains within a single service provider's network and traffic that crosses private peering points.As of December 2022 India and China controls almost half(48%) of the Internet traffic where as once a majority but now North America, Europe’s share got reduced to a quarter of the traffic of global internet.",0,wikipedia_csai

Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the surroundings. Based on the model, the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, etc.) and obstacles. [10][11]Once the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to impact the automobile industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields. Autonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels,[12] according to a system developed by SAE International (SAE J3016). [13] The SAE levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 – no automation; Level 1 – hands on/shared control; Level 2 – hands off; Level 3 – eyes off; Level 4 – mind off, and Level 5 – steering wheel optional.As of December 2022[update], vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor. In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona.

20710,18471,"Please explain what is ""Face ID""","Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc. for the iPhone and iPad Pro. The system allows biometric authentication for unlocking a device, making payments, accessing sensitive data, providing detailed facial expression tracking for Animoji, as well as six degrees of freedom (6DOF) head-tracking, eye-tracking, and other features. Initially released in November 2017 with the iPhone X, it has since been updated and introduced to several new iPhone models, and all iPad Pro models.The Face ID hardware consists of a sensor with three modules; a dot projector that projects a grid of small infrared dots onto a user's face, a module called the flood illuminator that shines infrared light at the face, and an infrared camera which takes an infrared picture of the user, reads the resulting pattern and generates a 3D facial map. This map is compared with the registered face using a secure subsystem, and the user is authenticated if the two faces match sufficiently. The system can recognize faces with glasses, clothing, makeup, and facial hair, and adapts to changes in appearance over time.Face ID has sparked a number of debates about security and privacy. Apple claims that Face ID is statistically more advanced than Touch ID fingerprint scanning. It exhibits significantly fewer false positives. Still, Face ID has shown issues at separating identical twins. Multiple security features largely limit the risk of the system being bypassed using photos or masks, and only one proof-of-concept attempt using detailed scans has succeeded. Debate continues over the lack of legal protections offered by biometric systems as compared to passcode authentication in the United States. Privacy advocates have also expressed concern about third-party app developers' access to ""rough maps"" of user facial data, despite rigid requirements by Apple of how developers handle facial data.On some devices, Face ID is unable to recognize users wearing face masks. Apple responded to criticism by offering faster fallback to passcode input, and the option for Apple Watch users to confirm whether they intended to unlock their iPhone.

Spam emails, also known as junk mail, are typically sent in large quantities by advertisers and marketers for the purpose of promoting their products or services. These emails can be a nuisance and can clog up a user's inbox, making it difficult to find important messages.Spam filters work by analyzing the content of incoming emails and identifying characteristics that are commonly associated with spam. For example, spam emails often contain certain words or phrases that are commonly used by spammers, such as ""free money"" or ""double your income."" They may also contain links to suspicious websites or attachments that could potentially contain malware.There are several different techniques that can be used to filter spam, including rules-based filtering, machine learning algorithms, and collaborative filtering. Rules-based filtering involves creating a set of rules or criteria that an email must meet in order to be considered spam. Machine learning algorithms are able to learn from examples of spam and non-spam emails and use this knowledge to identify new spam emails. Collaborative filtering involves analyzing the behavior of a group of users and using this information to identify spam emails.Spam filtering is an important tool for helping users manage their email inboxes and protect their computers from potential threats.

His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had ""an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960."" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.Fodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation. [citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.For Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or ""organs"", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the ""central processing"" part of the mind, which has a more global and less ""domain specific"" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs. : 73–75 Although Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection.",0,wikipedia_csai

He was known for his work on the philosophy of mind, language, and cognitive science. Fodor was born in New York City in 1935 and received his bachelor's degree from Columbia University in 1956. He went on to earn his PhD from Princeton University in 1960.Fodor is best known for his contributions to the philosophy of mind, particularly his defense of the idea that the mind is a modular system. This view holds that the mind is composed of a number of independent systems or modules, each of which is specialized for processing a particular type of information. Fodor argued that these modules are innate and dedicated to specific tasks, such as perception, language, and reasoning. He also proposed that mental states are individuated by their causal roles, which he called ""functional roles. ""Fodor was also a leading figure in the development of the theory of computationalism, which holds that the mind is a computational system and that mental processes can be understood in terms of computations. He argued that mental states can be explained in terms of the information that they carry and the operations that they perform on that information.Fodor's work has had a significant influence on the field of cognitive science and has been widely discussed and debated within the philosophy of mind. He was a professor at Rutgers University and the City University of New York, and was the author of numerous books and articles on the philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

Instrumental convergence posits that an intelligent agent with unbounded but apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole, unconstrained goal of solving an incredibly difficult mathematics problem like the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into one giant computer in an effort to increase its computational power so that it can succeed in its calculations.Proposed basic AI drives include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, self-improvement, and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.",0,wikipedia_csai

Each farmer may have different resources and techniques at their disposal, but they may all adopt similar strategies, such as using irrigation or fertilizers, in order to increase their yields. In this case, the farmers have converged on similar strategies as a result of their shared objective of increasing crop yields.Instrumental convergence can occur in many different contexts, including economic, social, and technological systems.

Often times, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more compute in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IOT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms. This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. One of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console. AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).AWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a ""Pay-as-you-go"" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g. physical security of the data centers) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g. account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including seven in North America.Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large-scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm.

When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias ""Neo"", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.The Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally.The Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value,[10][11] and was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year.

Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn feature in supporting roles.Despite the success of Alien, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated changes in management. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for Aliens in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for The Terminator (1984) and Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5 million budget, Aliens began principal photography in September 1985. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.Aliens was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein. The film received several awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked. Aliens earned $131.1–183.3 million during its theatrical run, one of the highest-grossing films of 1986 worldwide.Aliens is now considered among the greatest films of the 1980s, and among the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made, arguably equal to (or better than) Alien. The film is credited with expanding the franchise's scope with additions to the series' backstory and factions such as the Colonial Marines. Aliens inspired a variety of merchandise, including video games, comic books, and toys. The film was followed by two sequels – Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997), neither of which were as successful, and the prequels Prometheus (2012) and Alien: Covenant (2017).",0,wikipedia_csai

He wrote 44 novels and about 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime. His fiction explored varied philosophical and social questions such as the nature of reality, perception, human nature, and identity, and commonly featured characters struggling against elements such as alternate realities, illusory environments, monopolistic corporations, drug abuse, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness.Born in Chicago, Dick moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his family at a young age. He began publishing science fiction stories in 1952, at age 23. He found little commercial success until his alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle (1962) earned him acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel, when he was 33. He followed with science fiction novels such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ubik (1969). His 1974 novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.Following years of drug abuse and a series of mystical experiences in 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, metaphysics, and the nature of reality, as in novels A Scanner Darkly (1977), VALIS (1981), and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer (1982). A collection of his speculative nonfiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011). He died in 1982 in Santa Ana, California, at the age of 53, due to complications from a stroke. Following his death, he became ""widely regarded as a master of imaginative, paranoid fiction in the vein of Franz Kafka and Thomas Pynchon"". [10]Dick's posthumous influence has been widespread, extending beyond literary circles into Hollywood filmmaking. [11] Popular films based on his works include  Blade Runner (1982), Total Recall (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), Screamers (1995), Minority Report (2002), A Scanner Darkly (2006), The Adjustment Bureau (2011), and Radio Free Albemuth (2010). Beginning in 2015, Amazon Prime Video produced the multi-season television adaptation The Man in the High Castle, based on Dick's 1962 novel; and in 2017 Channel 4 began producing the ongoing anthology series Electric Dreams, based on various Dick stories.In 2005, Time magazine named Ubik (1969) one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923.

Prior to his acting career, he obtained a degree in law from the Kyiv National Economic University. He then pursued a career in comedy and created the production company Kvartal 95, which produced films, cartoons, and TV shows including the TV series Servant of the People, in which Zelenskyy played the role of the Ukrainian president. The series aired from 2015 to 2019 and was immensely popular. A political party bearing the same name as the television show was created in March 2018 by employees of Kvartal 95.Zelenskyy announced his candidacy in the 2019 presidential election on the evening of 31 December 2018, alongside the New Year's Eve address of then-president Petro Poroshenko on the TV channel 1+1. A political outsider, he had already become one of the frontrunners in opinion polls for the election. He won the election with 73.23 percent of the vote in the second round, defeating Poroshenko.

In contrast, in unsupervised learning, the model is not provided with any labeled examples and must learn to find patterns in the data on its own.Semi-supervised learning falls between these two approaches, as it involves using a small amount of labeled data along with a large amount of unlabeled data to train a model. The idea is that the model can learn from the labeled data and use that knowledge to make predictions about the unlabeled data. This can be especially useful in situations where it is expensive or time-consuming to label a large dataset, or when there is a limited amount of labeled data available.One way to implement semi-supervised learning is through the use of self-learning, where the model is first trained on a small amount of labeled data and then used to label additional examples from the unlabeled dataset. These newly labeled examples are then added to the training set and the model is re-trained. This process can be repeated multiple times until the model has learned to accurately predict the labels for the majority of the dataset.Semi-supervised learning has been successful in a number of applications, including natural language processing, image classification, and speech recognition.

20782,18581,"Please explain what is ""Principal Component Analysis""","Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science. The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of p{\displaystyle p} unit vectors, where the i{\displaystyle i}-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first i−1{\displaystyle i-1} vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.In data analysis, the first principal component of a set of  p{\displaystyle p} variables, presumed to be jointly normally distributed, is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through  p{\displaystyle p} iterations until all the variance is explained. PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.PCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The i{\displaystyle i}-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first i−1{\displaystyle i-1} principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.For either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of standard PCA have also been proposed.",0,wikipedia_csai
20783,18581,"Please explain what is ""Principal Component Analysis""","Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set. It does this by identifying the directions in which the data varies the most, and then projecting the data onto a new set of axes that are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other. These new axes are called ""principal components"", and they are ranked in order of importance, with the first principal component having the highest importance and the last principal component having the lowest importance.The purpose of PCA is to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the variance in the data as possible. This can be useful for visualizing the data, or for finding patterns in the data that might not be apparent in the original high-dimensional space.To perform PCA, you first need to standardize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Then, you compute the covariance matrix of the data, and use singular value decomposition (SVD) to decompose the covariance matrix into its principal components. Finally, you can select the number of principal components to keep, and project the data onto the resulting low-dimensional space.PCA is a widely used technique in data analysis and machine learning, and it has many applications, including feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and data visualization.",1,wikipedia_csai

One of these properties is that the output of the sigmoid function is always between 0 and 1, which makes it useful for modeling probabilities or binary classification problems. Another property is that the derivative of the sigmoid function is easy to compute, which makes it useful for training neural networks using gradient descent.The shape of the sigmoid function is S-shaped, with the output approaching 0 as the input becomes more negative and approaching 1 as the input becomes more positive.

The Lebesgue integral, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined.Long before the 20th century, mathematicians already understood that for non-negative functions with a smooth enough graph—such as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals—the area under the curve could be defined as the integral, and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons. However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose—e.g., as a result of the limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability—it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral. Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides the necessary abstractions for this.The Lebesgue integral plays an important role in probability theory, real analysis, and many other fields in mathematics. It is named after Henri Lebesgue (1875–1941), who introduced the integral (Lebesgue 1904). It is also a pivotal part of the axiomatic theory of probability.The term Lebesgue integration can mean either the general theory of integration of a function with respect to a general measure, as introduced by Lebesgue, or the specific case of integration of a function defined on a sub-domain of the real line with respect to the Lebesgue measure.",0,wikipedia_csai

It has become a standard tool in modern analysis and has many important applications in various areas of mathematics, including functional analysis, probability theory, and partial differential equations.The Lebesgue integral is defined in terms of measure theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the concept of ""measure,"" which is a way of assigning a size or length to sets. In particular, the Lebesgue integral is defined in terms of a measure called the Lebesgue measure, which is a way of assigning a measure to sets in the real line.To define the Lebesgue integral, we first need to define a measure space, which is a set equipped with a measure. In the case of the Lebesgue integral, the measure space is the set of real numbers equipped with the Lebesgue measure.Next, we need to define a real-valued function on the measure space. This is a function that assigns a real number to each element in the measure space.To define the Lebesgue integral of a function, we partition the measure space into a finite number of disjoint measurable sets, called ""measurable partitions."" We then assign a value to each measurable partition, called the ""integral over the measurable partition."" The Lebesgue integral of the function is then defined as the limit of the sum of the integrals over the measurable partitions as the number of partitions goes to infinity.The Lebesgue integral has many important properties, including the ability to integrate functions that are not continuous, and the ability to handle functions that have ""jumps"" or other singularities. It is also a very powerful tool for proving the convergence of sequences and series of functions.",1,wikipedia_csai

20789,18589,"Please explain what is ""Cumulative distribution function""","A cumulative distribution function (CDF) is a function that gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a certain value. More formally, the CDF is defined as:F(x) = P(X <= x)where F(x) is the CDF, P is the probability function, and X is the random variable. The CDF is a non-decreasing function, which means that as the value of x increases, the probability that X is less than or equal to x also increases.For example, suppose we have a random variable X that represents the time it takes for a particular task to complete. The CDF of X could be used to answer questions such as ""What is the probability that the task will take less than 1 hour to complete? "", or ""What is the probability that the task will take between 2 and 3 hours to complete? ""CDFs are often used in probability and statistics to describe the distribution of a random variable.

20791,18590,"Please explain what is ""Dropout (neural networks)""","In machine learning and neural networks, dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting. It works by randomly ""dropping out"" a certain number of neurons during training, which means temporarily setting the output of those neurons to zero. This has the effect of reducing the dependence of the model on any one particular neuron, and can help the model generalize better to new data.Dropout is typically applied to fully-connected layers in a neural network, although it can also be applied to convolutional layers. It is often used in conjunction with other regularization techniques such as weight decay (L2 regularization) and early stopping.To implement dropout in a neural network, we randomly set a certain percentage of neurons to zero during each training iteration. During inference (i.e., when making predictions on new data), we do not use dropout and instead use the entire network. This has the effect of ""averaging"" the predictions of all the dropped-out neurons, which helps reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.Dropout has been shown to be effective at reducing overfitting in deep neural networks and is a common technique used in modern deep learning models.",1,wikipedia_csai

20824,18654,"Please explain what is ""Vector space""","In mathematics and physics, a vector space (also called a linear space) is a set whose elements, often called vectors, may be added together and multiplied (""scaled"") by numbers called scalars. Scalars are often real numbers, but can be  complex numbers or, more generally, elements of any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called vector axioms. The terms real vector space and complex vector space are often used to specify the nature of the scalars: real coordinate space or complex coordinate space.Vector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors, which allow modeling of physical quantities, such as forces and velocity, that have not only a magnitude, but also a direction. The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra, together with the concept of matrix, which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations.Vector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that, for two vector spaces with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically the vector spaces are isomorphic). A vector space is finite-dimensional if its dimension is a natural number. Otherwise, it is infinite-dimensional, and its dimension is an infinite cardinal. Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, polynomial rings are countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension.Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures. This is the case of algebras, which include field extensions, polynomial rings, associative algebras and Lie algebras. This is also the case of topological vector spaces, which include function spaces, inner product spaces, normed spaces, Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.",0,wikipedia_csai

Four of the six known ebolaviruses, including EBOV, cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). Ebola virus has caused the majority of human deaths from EVD, and was the cause of the 2013–2016 epidemic in western Africa, which resulted in at least 28,646 suspected cases and 11,323 confirmed deaths.Ebola virus and its genus were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new ""strain"" of the closely related Marburg virus. The virus was renamed ""Ebola virus"" in 2010 to avoid confusion. Ebola virus is the single member of the species Zaire ebolavirus, which is assigned to the genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The members of the species are called Zaire ebolaviruses. The natural reservoir of Ebola virus is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans through body fluids.The EBOV genome is a single-stranded RNA, approximately 19,000 nucleotides long. It encodes seven structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), (VP40), GP, transcription activator (VP30), VP24, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). [10]Because of its high fatality rate (up to 83 to 90 percent),[11][12] EBOV is also listed as a select agent, World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment), a US National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogen, US CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agent, and a Biological Agent for Export Control by the Australia Group.

The Ebola virus is named after the Ebola River, which is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Africa, where the virus was first identified in 1976.The Ebola virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected animals, such as bats, primates, or humans. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact, breastfeeding, or the reuse of needles and syringes contaminated with the virus.Symptoms of Ebola virus disease (EVD) typically appear within 2 to 21 days after infection, although it can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to appear. Early symptoms of EVD may include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. As the disease progresses, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and external bleeding from the eyes, ears, and nose. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure and death.There is no specific treatment for EVD, and the virus has a high mortality rate.

It was proposed by Dmitry Ulyanov and his colleagues in a paper published in 2017.The idea behind Deep Image Prior is that the structure and features present in natural images can be used to guide the restoration of a damaged or degraded image. To do this, the authors trained a CNN on a large dataset of natural images and then used the trained network as a prior for solving inverse problems, such as image denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting.One of the key benefits of Deep Image Prior is that it can be used to restore images without the need for any training data. This is in contrast to traditional image restoration methods, which often require large amounts of training data to learn the relationships between the input and output images. Instead, Deep Image Prior relies on the inherent structure and features present in natural images, which are captured by the CNN, to guide the restoration process.Overall, Deep Image Prior is a promising approach for image restoration and inpainting, as it can produce high-quality results with minimal training data and can be used for a wide range of inverse problems.",1,wikipedia_csai

These regions differentiate and grow at different rates, and each plays a different role in the development of the brain and the body.After birth, the brain continues to develop and change. The brain undergoes a period of rapid growth during the first few years of life, during which time new connections between neurons, or brain cells, are formed. This process, known as neuroplasticity, allows the brain to adapt and change in response to new experiences.During childhood and adolescence, the brain continues to mature and develop. This process involves the strengthening of connections between neurons, the development of new neurons, and the strengthening and pruning of synapses, which are the connections between neurons.In adulthood, the brain continues to change and adapt, but at a slower rate than during childhood and adolescence.

The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.Generalized linear models were formulated by John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn as a way of unifying various other statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression and Poisson regression. They proposed an iteratively reweighted least squares method for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters. MLE remains popular and is the default method on many statistical computing packages. Other approaches, including Bayesian regression and least squares fitting to variance stabilized responses, have been developed.",0,wikipedia_csai
20853,18708,"Please explain what is ""Generalized linear model""","A generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible statistical model that can be used to analyze a wide range of data types. It is an extension of the linear regression model, which is used to model the relationship between a continuous response variable and one or more predictor variables.The key difference between a linear regression model and a GLM is that in a GLM, the response variable is not necessarily continuous and may follow a different distribution, such as a binomial, poisson, or gamma distribution. The GLM allows for the modeling of this type of data by using a link function to relate the mean of the response variable to a linear combination of the predictor variables.In a GLM, the response variable is assumed to follow a certain distribution, and the mean of this distribution is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables. The parameters of the model are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the data, which is the probability of observing the data given the model.Examples of GLMs include logistic regression for modeling binary data, Poisson regression for modeling count data, and gamma regression for modeling continuous data with a positive skew.",1,wikipedia_csai

It involves using probability theory and statistical methods to make predictions, decisions, and inferences based on uncertain or incomplete information.Probabilistic reasoning can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of future events, to evaluate the risk associated with different courses of action, and to make decisions under uncertainty. It is a common technique used in fields such as economics, finance, engineering, and the natural and social sciences.Probabilistic reasoning involves using probabilities, which are numerical measures of the likelihood of an event occurring. Probabilities can range from 0, which indicates that an event is impossible, to 1, which indicates that an event is certain to occur. Probabilities can also be expressed as percentages or fractions.Probabilistic reasoning can involve calculating the probability of a single event occurring, or it can involve calculating the probability of multiple events occurring simultaneously or in sequence. It can also involve calculating the probability of one event occurring given that another event has occurred.Probabilistic reasoning is an important tool for making informed decisions and for understanding the world around us, as it allows us to take into account the uncertainty and variability that are inherent in many real-world situations.",1,wikipedia_csai

20868,18727,"Please explain what is ""Array data structure""","In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.For example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i × 4).The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called ""matrices"". In some cases the term ""vector"" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables; the word ""table"" is sometimes used as a synonym of array.Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.The term ""array"" may also refer to an array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.The term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or ""abstract array"", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays.",0,wikipedia_csai
20869,18727,"Please explain what is ""Array data structure""","An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items, typically in a contiguous block of memory. The items in an array are usually of the same data type, and are accessed using an index.In many programming languages, an array is implemented as a fixed-size sequenced collection of elements of the same data type. Each element in the array is assigned a unique index, which is used to identify and access the element. The first element in the array is assigned an index of 0, the second element is assigned an index of 1, and so on.Here is an example of how you might declare and initialize an array of integers in C:Copy codeint numbers[5];numbers[0] = 10;numbers[1] = 20;numbers[2] = 30;numbers[3] = 40;numbers[4] = 50;In this example, we have declared an array called numbers that can hold 5 integers. We have then initialized the array by assigning values to each element in the array. We can access the elements of the array using their indexes, like this:Copy codeprintf(""%d"", numbers[0]);  // prints 10printf(""%d"", numbers[2]);  // prints 30Arrays are a useful data structure for storing and manipulating large amounts of data, but they have some limitations. For example, the size of an array is fixed when it is created, so you cannot easily add or remove elements from the array. In addition, arrays are not well-suited for inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the collection. For these types of operations, you might want to consider using a different data structure such as a linked list.",1,wikipedia_csai

Because of the complexity of the simulation, the objective function may become difficult and expensive to evaluate. Usually, the underlying simulation model is stochastic, so that the objective function must be estimated using statistical estimation techniques (called output analysis in simulation methodology).Once a system is mathematically modeled, computer-based simulations provide information about its behavior. Parametric simulation methods can be used to improve the performance of a system. In this method, the input of each variable is varied with other parameters remaining constant and the effect on the design objective is observed. This is a time-consuming method and improves the performance partially. To obtain the optimal solution with minimum computation and time, the problem is solved iteratively where in each iteration the solution moves closer to the optimum solution. Such methods are known as ‘numerical optimization’ or ‘simulation-based optimization’.In simulation experiment, the goal is to evaluate the effect of different values of input variables on a system. However, the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However, this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it just makes it intractable to run experiments for each scenario. For example, there might be too many possible values for input variables, or the simulation model might be too complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values. In these cases, the goal is to find optimal values for the input variables rather than trying all possible values. This process is called simulation optimization.Specific simulation–based optimization methods can be chosen according to Figure 1 based on the decision variable types.Optimization exists in two main branches of operations research:Optimization parametric (static) – The objective is to find the values of the parameters, which are “static” for all states, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing a function. In this case, one can use mathematical programming, such as linear programming. In this scenario, simulation helps when the parameters contain noise or the evaluation of the problem would demand excessive computer time, due to its complexity.Optimization control (dynamic) – This is used largely in computer science and electrical engineering. The optimal control is per state and the results change in each of them. One can use mathematical programming, as well as dynamic programming.

The optimization algorithm then uses these simulated outcomes to guide the search for the best solution.

This is done by finding a set of so-called ""independent components"" that are as independent as possible from each other, while still being able to reconstruct the mixed data.In practice, ICA is often used to separate a mixture of signals, such as audio signals or image data, into its component parts.

ICA algorithms are designed to find the independent components of the mixed data, even if the sources are non-Gaussian and correlated.",1,wikipedia_csai

The goal is to find a set of basis functions that can represent the data with as few coefficients as possible, while still preserving the important features of the data. This results in a sparse representation of the data, where most of the coefficients are zero or close to zero.Sparse coding has several benefits, including improved computational efficiency, reduced storage requirements, and better generalization to new data.

Here are some examples of data tensors whose observations are vectorized  or whose observations are matrices concatenated into data tensor images (2D/3D), video sequences (3D/4D), and hyperspectral cubes (3D/4D).The mapping from a high-dimensional vector space to a set of lower dimensional vector spaces is a multilinear projection. When observations are retained in the same organizational structure as matrices or higher order tensors, their representations are computed by performing linear projections into the column space, row space and fiber space.Multilinear subspace learning algorithms are higher-order generalizations of linear subspace learning methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA).",0,wikipedia_csai

20884,18759,"Please explain what is ""Web usage mining""","Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.The term ""data mining"" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics—or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning—are more appropriate.The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data. [10]The related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered.

A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.IDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. The most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of an HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of an NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach. The most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware) and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of ""good"" traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Another common variant is reputation-based detection (recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation scores). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions.

Often, one or more diagnostic procedures, such as medical tests, are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis.Diagnosis is often challenging because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific. For example, redness of the skin (erythema), by itself, is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis, in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns.

The resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula, especially in the case of a simple linear regression, in which there is a single regressor on the right side of the regression equation.The OLS estimator is consistent for the level-one fixed effects when the regressors are exogenous and forms perfect colinearity (rank condition), consistent for the variance estimate of the residuals when regressors have finite fourth moments  and—by the Gauss–Markov theorem—optimal in the class of linear unbiased estimators when the errors are homoscedastic and serially uncorrelated. Under these conditions, the method of OLS provides minimum-variance mean-unbiased estimation when the errors have finite variances.

Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems. [a] It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).The theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers “RIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems” and “RIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems”. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.Ridge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.",0,wikipedia_csai
20897,18785,"Please explain what is ""Ridge regression""","Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that aims to address the problem of multicollinearity, which occurs when predictors in a regression model are correlated. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable and inconsistent coefficient estimates, which can make it difficult to interpret the results of a regression model. Ridge regression addresses this issue by adding a penalty term to the regression objective function that shrinks the coefficients of the predictors towards zero. This shrinks the coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other, which can help to stabilize the model and improve its interpretability.Ridge regression is implemented by adding a penalty term to the least squares objective function, which is the objective function that is minimized in linear regression. The penalty term is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients. The objective function for ridge regression is given by:$J(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2$Where $\beta$ is the vector of coefficients, $y_i$ is the response variable, $x_{ij}$ is the predictor variable, and $\lambda$ is the penalty hyperparameter. The first term is the least squares objective function, and the second term is the penalty term.Ridge regression has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, and it can provide good performance even when there is multicollinearity in the data. However, it is important to tune the penalty hyperparameter to ensure that the model is not over- or under-regularized. Over-regularization can lead to a model that is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data, while under-regularization can result in a model that is too complex and overfits the data.",1,wikipedia_csai

However, the interpretation of probability is philosophically complicated, and even in specific cases is not always straightforward. The purely mathematical analysis of random variables is independent of such interpretational difficulties, and can be based upon a rigorous axiomatic setup.In the formal mathematical language of measure theory, a random variable is defined as a measurable function from a probability measure space (called the sample space) to a measurable space. This allows consideration of the pushforward measure, which is called the distribution of the random variable; the distribution is thus a probability measure on the set of all possible values of the random variable. It is possible for two random variables to have identical distributions but to differ in significant ways; for instance, they may be independent.It is common to consider the special cases of discrete random variables and absolutely continuous random variables, corresponding to whether a random variable is valued in a discrete set (such as a finite set) or in an interval of real numbers. There are other important possibilities, especially in the theory of stochastic processes, wherein it is natural to consider random sequences or random functions.

20906,18798,"Please explain what is ""Natural selection""","Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term ""natural selection"", contrasting it with artificial selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.Variation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and their offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to survive and reproduce more than individuals with other less successful variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success include sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.Natural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism which actually interact with the environment, but the genetic(heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation  (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.Natural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.",0,wikipedia_csai

This process ultimately leads to the evolution of species over time.The theory of natural selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century, and it remains one of the most important concepts in the field of biology. According to the theory, natural selection occurs because individuals within a population vary in their traits, and some of these traits are more advantageous than others in a particular environment. For example, a population of gazelles that live in a grassland habitat may have individuals with longer legs, which allow them to run faster and escape from predators more effectively. These individuals would be more likely to survive and reproduce, and as a result, the trait of long legs would be more common in the population over time.Natural selection is one of the main mechanisms of evolution, and it has shaped the diversity of life on Earth as we know it today.",1,wikipedia_csai
20908,18801,"Please explain what is ""Evolutionary algorithm""","In computational intelligence (CI), an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation, a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.",0,wikipedia_csai
20909,18801,"Please explain what is ""Evolutionary algorithm""","An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a type of optimization algorithm that uses principles inspired by the process of natural evolution to find solutions to problems. EAs are commonly used to find solutions to problems that are too difficult to be solved using traditional algorithms or that have too many variables to be solved using brute force methods.EAs work by mimicking the process of natural selection and evolution. This process involves the following steps:Initialization: A population of solutions is generated randomly or using some heuristic method.Evaluation: The solutions in the population are evaluated based on some predetermined objective function. The objective function measures how well a particular solution fits the problem.Selection: The solutions in the population are ranked based on their fitness, and the fittest solutions are selected to be used in the next generation.Reproduction: The selected solutions are used to produce a new generation of solutions through processes such as crossover (combining solutions from different parents) and mutation (randomly altering solutions).Repeat: The process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found or a predetermined number of iterations have been completed.EAs are particularly useful for solving problems that are difficult to solve using traditional algorithms because they are able to find good solutions in a relatively short amount of time, even when the problem is very complex. EAs are also able to handle problems with many variables and can find good solutions even when there are multiple conflicting objectives.",1,wikipedia_csai

In a DAI system, each agent or system has its own computing resources, knowledge base, and decision-making capabilities, and they communicate and coordinate with each other to achieve a shared objective.One of the main benefits of DAI is that it allows for the distribution of tasks and responsibilities among multiple agents or systems, which can be more efficient and effective than a single centralized system. For example, a DAI system could be used to monitor and control a large, distributed network of devices, such as sensors in an industrial plant or traffic lights in a city. In this case, each device could be equipped with an AI agent that is responsible for monitoring and controlling the device, while the overall system coordinates the actions of the individual agents to achieve a common goal.DAI can also be used to tackle complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of a single AI system. For example, a group of AI agents working together as a DAI system could be used to analyze and interpret large amounts of data, such as images or text, and extract meaningful insights or make predictions.Overall, DAI has the potential to enable the development of more sophisticated and capable AI systems that can operate at a larger scale and handle more complex tasks.",1,wikipedia_csai

Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device.

It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice. In a prediction problem, a model is usually given a dataset of known data on which training is run (training dataset), and a dataset of unknown data (or first seen data) against which the model is tested (called the validation dataset or testing set). The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias[10] and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem).One round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the validation set or testing set). To reduce variability, in most methods multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the validation results are combined (e.g. averaged) over the rounds to give an estimate of the model's predictive performance.In summary, cross-validation combines (averages) measures of fitness in prediction to derive a more accurate estimate of model prediction performance.

20923,18814,"Please explain what is ""Cross-validation (statistics)""","Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. It involves dividing a dataset into a training set, which is used to train the model, and a test set, which is used to evaluate the model. The idea behind cross-validation is to use a portion of the data for training and a different portion for testing, and to repeat this process multiple times in order to get a better estimate of the model's performance.There are several different types of cross-validation, including:K-fold cross-validation: In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds, and the remaining fold is used as the test set. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold being used as the test set each time. The final performance measure is the average of the performance measures obtained on each of the k folds.Leave-one-out cross-validation: In leave-one-out cross-validation, the model is trained on all but one of the data points, and the remaining point is used as the test set. This process is repeated for each data point, resulting in k test sets (where k is the number of data points in the dataset). The final performance measure is the average of the performance measures obtained on each of the k test sets.Stratified k-fold cross-validation: In stratified k-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into k folds, but the folds are stratified to ensure that each fold has a representative proportion of each class. This is particularly useful when the classes in the dataset are imbalanced (i.e., there are significantly more examples of one class than the other).Cross-validation is a widely used technique for evaluating the performance of machine learning models because it helps to reduce the risk of overfitting (i.e., the model performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen data).

MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s; a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard's 1960 book, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in many disciplines, including robotics, automatic control, economics and manufacturing. The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains.At each time step, the process is in some state s{\displaystyle s}, and the decision maker may choose any action a{\displaystyle a} that is available in state s{\displaystyle s}. The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state s′{\displaystyle s'}, and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward Ra(s,s′){\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}.The probability that the process moves into its new state s′{\displaystyle s'} is influenced by the chosen action. Specifically, it is given by the state transition function Pa(s,s′){\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')}. Thus, the next state s′{\displaystyle s'} depends on the current state s{\displaystyle s} and the decision maker's action a{\displaystyle a}. But given s{\displaystyle s} and a{\displaystyle a}, it is conditionally independent of all previous states and actions; in other words, the state transitions of an MDP satisfy the Markov property.Markov decision processes are an extension of Markov chains; the difference is the addition of actions (allowing choice) and rewards (giving motivation). Conversely, if only one action exists for each state (e.g. ""wait"") and all rewards are the same (e.g. ""zero""), a Markov decision process reduces to a Markov chain.",0,wikipedia_csai
20939,18839,"Please explain what is ""Policy iteration""","Policy iteration is an algorithm for finding an optimal policy in a Markov decision process (MDP). MDPs are a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making problems, where an agent takes actions in an environment in order to maximize a reward.The policy iteration algorithm works by alternating between two steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement.In the policy evaluation step, the algorithm estimates the value of each state under the current policy, using a value iteration algorithm. This involves iteratively updating the values of each state until they converge to the expected return of the current policy.In the policy improvement step, the algorithm updates the policy based on the values calculated in the policy evaluation step. This involves choosing the action that maximizes the expected return at each state, resulting in a new, improved policy.The algorithm continues to alternate between these two steps until the policy converges to the optimal policy. The optimal policy is the policy that maximizes the expected return for all states in the MDP.Policy iteration is a useful algorithm for solving MDPs because it can find the optimal policy even if the transition probabilities and rewards are not known. It is also relatively efficient, with a computational complexity of O(n^2) for an MDP with n states. However, it may require a large number of iterations to converge, especially for large or complex MDPs.",1,wikipedia_csai
20940,18841,"Please explain what is ""Lazy evaluation""","In programming language theory, lazy evaluation, or call-by-need, is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which also avoids repeated evaluations (sharing).The benefits of lazy evaluation include: Lazy evaluation is often combined with memoization, as described in Jon Bentley's Writing Efficient Programs. After a function's value is computed for that parameter or set of parameters, the result is stored in a lookup table that is indexed by the values of those parameters; the next time the function is called, the table is consulted to determine whether the result for that combination of parameter values is already available. If so, the stored result is simply returned. If not, the function is evaluated and another entry is added to the lookup table for reuse.Lazy evaluation is difficult to combine with imperative features such as exception handling and input/output, because the order of operations becomes indeterminate. The opposite of lazy evaluation is eager evaluation, sometimes known as strict evaluation. Eager evaluation is the evaluation strategy employed in most[quantify] programming languages.",0,wikipedia_csai

This approach is often used to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations, and it can also be used to facilitate the creation of infinite data structures.In many programming languages, expressions are evaluated as soon as they are encountered during the execution of a program. However, with lazy evaluation, the evaluation of an expression is delayed until it is actually required. This can be accomplished through the use of special constructs, such as lazy variables or lazy functions, which are evaluated only when they are accessed or called.One common use of lazy evaluation is to improve the performance of a program by avoiding the computation of unnecessary values. For example, if a program needs to perform a computation that involves a large data set, it may be more efficient to use lazy evaluation to compute only the values that are actually needed, rather than computing the entire data set and then discarding the unused values.Lazy evaluation can also be used to create infinite data structures, such as streams or lists that can be traversed indefinitely. In these cases, the evaluation of an expression is delayed until the next value in the data structure is needed, allowing the data structure to be constructed on the fly as it is traversed.Overall, lazy evaluation is a powerful technique that can be used to improve the performance and expressiveness of a program by allowing it to compute only the values that are actually needed.",1,wikipedia_csai

20943,18842,"Please explain what is ""Temporal difference""","Temporal difference (TD) learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to learn about the expected future rewards of an agent's actions in a Markov decision process (MDP). It is a type of model-free reinforcement learning, which means that it does not require a model of the environment or its transitions in order to learn.In TD learning, the agent estimates the value of each state or action by using a temporal difference error (TD error) to update its value function. The TD error is calculated as the difference between the expected reward for an action and the actual reward received. This error is then used to update the value function, which guides the agent's decisions about which actions to take in the future.TD learning can be used to learn value functions for both state values (the expected future reward of being in a particular state) and action values (the expected future reward of taking a particular action). It can also be used to learn about the expected future rewards of policies, which are sets of actions that the agent follows in different states.TD learning has several advantages over other reinforcement learning algorithms. It is simple to implement, and it can learn online, meaning that it can update its value function as it receives new rewards and transitions.

This is achieved by representing the linguistic variables A and B using fuzzy sets. In a fuzzy rule, modus ponens is extended to generalised modus ponens:.The key difference is that the premise x is A can be only partially true. As a result, the consequent y is B is also partially true. Truth is represented as a real number between 0 and 1, where 0 is false and 1 is true.",0,wikipedia_csai

Fuzzy logic systems are used in a variety of applications, including control systems, decision-making systems, and pattern recognition systems.A fuzzy rule typically consists of a condition part, which specifies the input variables, and a conclusion part, which specifies the output variable. The condition part of the rule is usually written in the form of an if-then statement, and the conclusion part is written in the form of a then-statement.For example, a simple fuzzy rule might be:If the temperature is hot, then the air conditioning should be turned on.In this example, the input variable is the temperature, and the output variable is the state of the air conditioning. The condition part of the rule specifies that if the temperature is hot, then the conclusion part of the rule should be followed, which is to turn the air conditioning on.Fuzzy rules can be used in combination with other techniques, such as fuzzy inference systems, to make decisions or control systems based on input data that may be imprecise or uncertain.

The concept originates from the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model.A Markov network or MRF is similar to a Bayesian network in its representation of dependencies; the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic, whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic.

This means that, compared to elementary Euclidean geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called ""points at infinity"") to Euclidean points, and vice-versa.Properties meaningful for projective geometry are respected by this new idea of transformation, which is more radical in its effects than can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first issue for geometers is what kind of geometry is adequate for a novel situation. It is not possible to refer to angles in projective geometry as it is in Euclidean geometry, because angle is an example of a concept not invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in perspective drawing. One source for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into projective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See projective plane for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions.While the ideas were available earlier, projective geometry was mainly a development of the 19th century. This included the theory of complex projective space, the coordinates used (homogeneous coordinates) being complex numbers. Several major types of more abstract mathematics (including invariant theory, the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and Felix Klein's Erlangen programme resulting in the study of the classical groups) were motivated by projective geometry. It was also a subject with many practitioners for its own sake, as synthetic geometry. Another topic that developed from axiomatic studies of projective geometry is finite geometry.The topic of projective geometry is itself now divided into many research subtopics, two examples of which are projective algebraic geometry (the study of projective varieties) and projective differential geometry (the study of differential invariants of the projective transformations).",0,wikipedia_csai

This technique is used to create photorealistic images or animations that are difficult or impossible to generate with traditional rendering techniques.There are several different approaches to IBR, but they all involve capturing images of a scene from different viewpoints or under different lighting conditions and using those images to synthesize a final image or animation. The captured images are often called ""textures"" or ""environment maps,"" and they can be used to represent the appearance of objects in the scene, the lighting and shading of the scene, or both.One common approach to IBR is to use a set of panoramic images, also known as ""spherical harmonics,"" to represent the appearance and lighting of a scene. These images are captured by taking a series of photographs of the scene from a single point, with each photograph covering a different direction. The resulting images can then be combined to create a single, high-resolution panoramic image that represents the appearance of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. This image can be used to render the scene from any viewpoint within the field of view of the panoramic image.Another approach to IBR is to use ""image-based lighting,"" which involves capturing the lighting of a scene using high dynamic range (HDR) images or light probes. These images can be used to synthesize the lighting of a scene from any viewpoint, allowing artists to create realistic lighting effects without having to calculate the lighting of the scene from scratch.IBR has many applications in film, television, video games, and other areas where photorealistic images or animations are desired.

20966,18878,"Please explain what is ""Electromagnetic radiation""","In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) consists of waves of the electromagnetic (EM) field, which propagate through space and carry momentum and electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. All of these waves form part of the electromagnetic spectrum.Classically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. Depending on the frequency of oscillation, different wavelengths of electromagnetic spectrum are produced. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, commonly denoted c. In homogeneous, isotropic media, the oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. The position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum can be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength. Electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter. In order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.Electromagnetic waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration, and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles, exerting force on them. EM waves carry energy, momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact. Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves (""radiate"") without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field. In this language, the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena.In quantum mechanics, an alternate way of viewing EMR is that it consists of photons, uncharged elementary particles with zero rest mass which are the quanta of the electromagnetic field, responsible for all electromagnetic interactions. Quantum electrodynamics is the theory of how EMR interacts with matter on an atomic level. Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation. The energy of an individual photon is quantized and is greater for photons of higher frequency. This relationship is given by Planck's equation E = hf, where E is the energy per photon, f is the frequency of the photon, and h is Planck's constant. A single gamma ray photon, for example, might carry ~100,000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light.The effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's power and its frequency. EMR of visible or lower frequencies (i.e., visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is called non-ionizing radiation, because its photons do not individually have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules, or break chemical bonds. The effects of these radiations on chemical systems and living tissue are caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high frequency ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are called ionizing radiation, since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds. These radiations have the ability to cause chemical reactions and damage living cells beyond that resulting from simple heating, and can be a health hazard.",0,wikipedia_csai

Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).Quantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which explained the photoelectric effect. These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the ""old quantum theory"", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac and others. The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms. In one of them, a mathematical entity called the wave function provides information, in the form of probability amplitudes, about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum, and other physical properties may yield.",0,wikipedia_csai

These quantum particles do not behave like classical particles, which we are used to seeing in our everyday lives. Instead, they exhibit properties that are fundamentally different and often counterintuitive.One of the most famous examples of this is the uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to know both the exact position and the exact momentum of a quantum particle at the same time. This means that, on a quantum level, the world is fundamentally unpredictable and probabilistic.Quantum physics has had a huge impact on our understanding of the universe and has led to many important technological developments, such as transistors, lasers, and computer memory.

Path planning is effectively an extension of localisation, in that it requires the determination of the robot's current position and a position of a goal location, both within the same frame of reference or coordinates. Map building can be in the shape of a metric map or any notation describing locations in the robot frame of reference. [citation needed]For any mobile device, the ability to navigate in its environment is important. Avoiding dangerous situations such as collisions and unsafe conditions (temperature, radiation, exposure to weather, etc.) comes first, but if the robot has a purpose that relates to specific places in the robot environment, it must find those places.This article will present an overview of the skill of navigation and try to identify the basic blocks of a robot navigation system, types of navigation systems, and closer look at its related building components.Robot navigation means the robot's ability to determine its own position in its frame of reference and then to plan a path towards some goal location. In order to navigate in its environment, the robot or any other mobility device requires representation, i.e. a map of the environment and the ability to interpret that representation.Navigation can be defined as the combination of the three fundamental competences:Some robot navigation systems use simultaneous localization and mapping to generate 3D reconstructions of their surroundings.",0,wikipedia_csai

It requires the integration of various technologies, including sensors, control systems, and algorithms, to allow the robot to navigate effectively and efficiently in different environments.There are several approaches to robot navigation, including reactive, deliberative, and hybrid approaches. Reactive approaches involve the robot reacting to its immediate surroundings, using sensors to detect and avoid obstacles. Deliberative approaches involve the robot planning a path to its goal based on a map of the environment, and then executing the plan. Hybrid approaches involve combining both reactive and deliberative approaches to allow the robot to adapt to changing environments and achieve its goals.Robot navigation is a complex and challenging task, as it requires the robot to be able to perceive and understand its environment, make decisions based on that information, and execute actions in a coordinated and efficient manner.",1,wikipedia_csai

Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.CAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain.CAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.Although CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.",0,wikipedia_csai

20998,18931,"Please explain what is ""Sequential pattern mining""","Sequential pattern mining is a topic of data mining concerned with finding statistically relevant patterns between data examples where the values are delivered in a sequence. It is usually presumed that the values are discrete, and thus time series mining is closely related, but usually considered a different activity. Sequential pattern mining is a special case of structured data mining.There are several key traditional computational problems addressed within this field. These include building efficient databases and indexes for sequence information, extracting the frequently occurring patterns, comparing sequences for similarity, and recovering missing sequence members. In general, sequence mining problems can be classified as string mining which is typically based on string processing algorithms  and itemset mining which is typically based on association rule learning. Local process models  extend sequential pattern mining to more complex patterns that can include (exclusive) choices, loops, and concurrency constructs in addition to the sequential ordering construct.",0,wikipedia_csai
20999,18931,"Please explain what is ""Sequential pattern mining""","Sequential pattern mining is a process of finding patterns in data that are ordered in some way. It is a type of data mining that involves searching for patterns in sequential data, such as time series, transaction data, or other types of ordered data.In sequential pattern mining, the goal is to identify patterns that occur frequently in the data. These patterns can be used to make predictions about future events, or to understand the underlying structure of the data.There are several algorithms and techniques that can be used for sequential pattern mining, including the Apriori algorithm, the ECLAT algorithm, and the SPADE algorithm. These algorithms use various techniques to identify patterns in the data, such as counting the frequency of items or looking for correlations between items.Sequential pattern mining has a wide range of applications, including market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.

21000,18933,"Please explain what is ""Marketing campaign""","Marketing is the process of exploring, creating, and delivering value to meet the needs of a target market in terms of goods and services; potentially including selection of a target audience; selection of certain attributes or themes to emphasize in advertising; operation of advertising campaigns; attendance at trade shows and public events; design of products and packaging attractive to buyers; defining the terms of sale, such as price, discounts, warranty, and return policy; product placement in media or with people believed to influence the buying habits of others; agreements with retailers, wholesale distributors, or resellers; and attempts to create awareness of, loyalty to, and positive feelings about a brand. Marketing is typically done by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Sometimes tasks are contracted to a dedicated marketing firm or advertising agency. More rarely, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk? ), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. Marketers can direct their product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing). Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. Known as market orientations, they determine how marketers approach the planning stage of marketing.The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research,[10] and the characteristics of the product's target market. [11] Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements.

21002,18934,"Please explain what is ""Data dredging""","Data dredging (also known as data snooping or p-hacking)[a] is the misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant, thus dramatically increasing and understating the risk of false positives. This is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.The process of data dredging involves testing multiple hypotheses using a single data set by exhaustively searching—perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a correlation, and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.Conventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis). This level of risk is called the significance. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type; hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 5% significance level, 1% might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be reported to be statistically significant (even though this is misleading), since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results.Data dredging is an example of disregarding the multiple comparisons problem. One form is when subgroups are compared without alerting the reader to the total number of subgroup comparisons examined.",0,wikipedia_csai

This can be a problem because it increases the likelihood of finding false positive results, which can be misleading and can lead to incorrect conclusions.To avoid data dredging, researchers should be careful to follow proper statistical practices and should clearly define their research questions and hypotheses before collecting and analyzing data.

The city is known for its mild year-round climate, natural deep-water harbor, extensive beaches and parks, long association with the United States Navy, and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center. San Diego is the second largest city in the state of California, after Los Angeles.Historically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego is frequently referred to as the ""Birthplace of California"", as it was the first site visited and settled by Europeans on what is now the U.S. west coast. [12] Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later. California became part of the U.S. in 1848 following the Mexican–American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.San Diego's main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, research, and manufacturing. The city is the economic center of the San Diego–Tijuana conurbation, the second most populous transborder metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere (after Detroit–Windsor), home to an estimated 4,922,723 people as of 2012. [13] The primary border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, the San Ysidro Port of Entry, is the busiest international land border crossing in the world outside of Asia (fourth-busiest overall).

It is bicameral, composed of a lower body, the House of Representatives, and an upper body, the Senate. It meets in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.The sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 establishes that there be 435 representatives and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the Congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one Congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states.Article One of the U.S. Constitution requires that members of Congress must be at least 25 years old (House) or at least 30 years old (Senate), have been a citizen of the U.S. for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent.

Weak artificial intelligence focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems. As opposed to strong AI, which uses technology to be able to think and learn on its own. Computers are able to use methods such as algorithms and prior knowledge to develop their own ways of thinking like human beings do. Strong artificial intelligence systems are learning how to run independently of the programmers who programmed them. Weak AI is not able to have a mind of its own, and can only imitate physical behaviors that it can observe. It is contrasted with Strong AI, which is defined variously as: Scholars like Antonio Lieto have argued that the current research on both AI and cognitive modelling are perfectly aligned with the weak-AI hypothesis (that should not be confused with the ""general"" vs ""narrow"" AI distinction) and that the popular assumption that cognitively inspired AI systems espouse the strong AI hypothesis is ill-posed and problematic since ""artificial models of brain and mind can be used to understand mental phenomena without pretending that that they are the real phenomena that they are modelling""  (p. 85) (as, on the other hand, implied by the strong AI assumption).AI can be classified as being “… limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category.”  Narrow means the robot or computer is strictly limited to only being able to solve one problem at a time. Strong AI is conversely the opposite. Strong AI is as close to the human brain or mind as possible. This is all believed to be the case by philosopher John Searle. This idea of strong AI is also controversial, and Searle believes that the Turing test (created by Alan Turing during WW2, originally called the Imitation Game, used to test if a machine is as intelligent as a human) is not accurate or appropriate for testing strong AI.

21028,18979,"Please explain what is ""Mind–body dualism""","In the philosophy of mind, mind–body dualism denotes either the view that mental phenomena are non-physical, or that the mind and body are distinct and separable. Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, as well as between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mind–body problem.Aristotle shared Plato's view of multiple souls and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and humans: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only humans and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to humans only. In this view, a soul is the hylomorphic form of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance of the preceding level. For Aristotle, the first two souls, based on the body, perish when the living organism dies, whereas remains an immortal and perpetual intellective part of mind. For Plato, however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body. It has been considered a form of reductionism by some philosophers, since it enables the tendency to ignore very big groups of variables by its assumed association with the mind or the body, and not for its real value when it comes to explaining or predicting a studied phenomenon.Dualism is closely associated with the thought of René Descartes (1641), which holds that the mind is a nonphysical—and therefore, non-spatial—substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence. Hence, he was the first documented Western philosopher to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it exists today. Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism. Substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism, but property dualism may be considered a form of emergent materialism or non-reductive physicalism in some sense.",0,wikipedia_csai
21029,18979,"Please explain what is ""Mind–body dualism""","Mind–body dualism is a philosophical position that holds that the mind and the body are two distinct and separate entities. According to this view, the mind is an immaterial substance that is not subject to the same physical laws as the body. It is sometimes referred to as Cartesian dualism, after the French philosopher René Descartes, who is credited with its development.Descartes argued that the mind is a non-physical substance that is capable of thinking, feeling, and perceiving, while the body is a physical substance that is subject to the laws of physics. He believed that the mind and the body interact with each other, but that they are fundamentally distinct.There are several different versions of mind–body dualism, and philosophers continue to debate the plausibility of this view. Some argue that it is necessary to posit the existence of an immaterial mind in order to account for the subjective experiences of consciousness, while others argue that it is more parsimonious to posit that the mind is a product of the physical brain and its functions.",1,wikipedia_csai
21030,18981,"Please explain what is ""Human computation""","Human-based computation (HBC), human-assisted computation, ubiquitous human computing or distributed thinking (by analogy to distributed computing) is a computer science technique in which a machine performs its function by outsourcing certain steps to humans, usually as microwork. This approach uses differences in abilities and alternative costs between humans and computer agents to achieve symbiotic human–computer interaction. For computationally difficult tasks such as image recognition, human-based computation plays a central role in training Deep Learning-based Artificial Intelligence systems. In this case, human-based computation has been referred to as human-aided artificial intelligence.In traditional computation, a human employs a computer to solve a problem; a human provides a formalized problem description and an algorithm to a computer, and receives a solution to interpret. Human-based computation frequently reverses the roles; the computer asks a person or a large group of people to solve a problem, then collects, interprets, and integrates their solutions. This turns hybrid networks of humans and computers into ""large scale distributed computing networks"". where code is partially executed in human brains and on silicon based processors.",0,wikipedia_csai

21048,19009,"Please explain what is ""Cerebral cortex""","The cerebral cortex, also known as the cerebral mantle, is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain in humans and other mammals. The cerebral cortex mostly consists of the six-layered neocortex, with just 10% consisting of allocortex. It is separated into two cortices, by the longitudinal fissure that divides the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The two hemispheres are joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system. It plays a key role in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and consciousness. The cerebral cortex is part of the brain responsible for cognition.In most mammals, apart from small mammals that have small brains, the cerebral cortex is folded, providing a greater surface area in the confined volume of the cranium. Apart from minimising brain and cranial volume, cortical folding is crucial for the brain circuitry and its functional organisation. In mammals with small brains there is no folding and the cortex is smooth.A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and a groove is termed a sulcus (plural sulci). These surface convolutions appear during fetal development and continue to mature after birth through the process of gyrification. In the human brain the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible from the outside, but buried in the sulci. The major sulci and gyri mark the divisions of the cerebrum into the lobes of the brain. The four major lobes are the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Other lobes are the limbic lobe, and the insular cortex often referred to as the insular lobe.There are between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the human cerebral cortex.

In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. While Moore did not use empirical evidence in forecasting that the historical trend would continue, his prediction held since 1975 and has since become known as a ""law"".Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning to some extent as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Based on this trend, he predicted that the number of transistors on a microchip would continue to double approximately every 18-24 months, leading to exponential increases in the processing power and decrease in the cost of computers.Moore's Law has largely held true for the past several decades, leading to rapid advancements in technology and the proliferation of computers and other electronic devices in society. However, there has been some debate in recent years about the sustainability of Moore's Law, as the physical limitations of transistors and other components may eventually make it difficult to continue doubling the number of transistors on a microchip.

The Schickard machine was particularly notable for its integration of an ingenious system of rotated Napier's rods for multiplication with a first known design for an adding machine, operated by rotating knobs for input, and with a register of rotated numbers showing in windows for output. Taton has argued that Schickard's work had no impact on the development of mechanical calculators. [10]  However, whilst there can be debate about what constitutes a ""mechanical calculator"" later devices, such as Moreland's multiplying and adding instruments when used together, Caspar Schott's Cistula, René Grillet's machine arithmétique, and Claude Perrault's rhabdologique at the end of the century, and later, the Bamberger Omega developed in the early 20th century, certainly followed the same path pioneered by Schickard with his ground breaking combination of a form of Napier's rods and adding machine designed to assist multiplication.

21068,19041,"Please explain what is ""Mechanical calculator""","A mechanical calculator, or calculating machine, is a mechanical device used to perform the basic operations of arithmetic automatically, or (historically) a simulation such as an analog computer or a slide rule. Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small desktop computers and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the electronic calculator and the digital computer.Surviving notes from Wilhelm Schickard in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation. His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of Napier's bones, to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions. A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that would have jammed after a few entries on the same dial, and that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999). Schickard abandoned his project in 1624 and never mentioned it again until his death 11 years later in 1635.Two decades after Schickard's supposedly failed attempt, in 1642, Blaise Pascal decisively solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator. Co-opted into his father's labour as tax collector in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required; it was called Pascal's Calculator or Pascaline.Thomas' arithmometer, the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured two hundred years later in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale until the industrial production of the more successful Odhner Arithmometer in 1890.The comptometer, introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard that consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured in 1902, was the first to have a 10 key keyboard. Electric motors were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901. In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the Anita Mk VII from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all-electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop in the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.Charles Babbage designed two new kinds of mechanical calculators, which were so big that they required the power of a steam engine to operate, and that were too sophisticated to be built in his lifetime. The first one was an automatic mechanical calculator, his difference engine, which could automatically compute and print mathematical tables. In 1855, Georg Scheutz became the first of a handful of designers to succeed at building a smaller and simpler model of his difference engine. The second one was a programmable mechanical calculator, his analytical engine, which Babbage started to design in 1834; ""in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom""[10] making it infinitely programmable. [11] In 1937, Howard Aiken convinced IBM to design and build the ASCC/Mark I, the first machine of its kind, based on the architecture of the analytical engine;[12] when the machine was finished some hailed it as ""Babbage's dream come true"".

An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a Finite Automaton (FA) or Finite-State Machine (FSM). The figure on the right illustrates a finite-state machine, which is a well-known type of automaton.

The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.If proving a statement requires that the prover possess some secret information, then the verifier will not be able to prove the statement to anyone else without possessing the secret information. The statement being proved must include the assertion that the prover has such knowledge, but without including or transmitting the knowledge itself in the assertion. Otherwise, the statement would not be proved in zero-knowledge because it provides the verifier with additional information about the statement by the end of the protocol. A zero-knowledge proof of knowledge is a special case when the statement consists only of the fact that the prover possesses the secret information.Interactive zero-knowledge proofs require interaction between the individual (or computer system) proving their knowledge and the individual validating the proof.A protocol implementing zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge must necessarily require interactive input from the verifier. This interactive input is usually in the form of one or more challenges such that the responses from the prover will convince the verifier if and only if the statement is true, i.e., if the prover does possess the claimed knowledge. If this were not the case, the verifier could record the execution of the protocol and replay it to convince someone else that they possess the secret information. The new party's acceptance is either justified since the replayer does possess the information (which implies that the protocol leaked information, and thus, is not proved in zero-knowledge), or the acceptance is spurious, i.e., was accepted from someone who does not actually possess the information.Some forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs exist, but the validity of the proof relies on computational assumptions (typically the assumptions of an ideal cryptographic hash function).",0,wikipedia_csai

This is useful in situations where the prover wants to prove their knowledge or possession of certain information, but does not want to reveal the actual information to the verifier.For example, suppose Alice wants to prove to Bob that she knows the secret password to a certain system, but she doesn't want to reveal the actual password to Bob. Alice can use a zero-knowledge proof to prove to Bob that she knows the password, without revealing the password itself.Zero-knowledge proofs are based on the idea of interactive proof systems, in which the prover and verifier engage in a back-and-forth interaction to determine the truth of a statement.

This makes zero-knowledge proofs particularly useful in situations where the prover and verifier do not trust each other, or do not want to reveal any information beyond the fact that a statement is true.Zero-knowledge proofs have many applications, including in cryptography, where they are used to prove the authenticity of digital signatures and to secure online transactions.

A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware products. A text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions into speech. The reverse process is speech recognition.Synthesized speech can be created by concatenating pieces of recorded speech that are stored in a database. Systems differ in the size of the stored speech units; a system that stores phones or diphones provides the largest output range, but may lack clarity. For specific usage domains, the storage of entire words or sentences allows for high-quality output. Alternatively, a synthesizer can incorporate a model of the vocal tract and other human voice characteristics to create a completely ""synthetic"" voice output.The quality of a speech synthesizer is judged by its similarity to the human voice and by its ability to be understood clearly. An intelligible text-to-speech program allows people with visual impairments or reading disabilities to listen to written words on a home computer. Many computer operating systems have included speech synthesizers since the early 1990s.A text-to-speech system (or ""engine"") is composed of two parts: a front-end and a back-end. The front-end has two major tasks. First, it converts raw text containing symbols like numbers and abbreviations into the equivalent of written-out words. This process is often called text normalization, pre-processing, or tokenization. The front-end then assigns phonetic transcriptions to each word, and divides and marks the text into prosodic units, like phrases, clauses, and sentences. The process of assigning phonetic transcriptions to words is called text-to-phoneme or grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Phonetic transcriptions and prosody information together make up the symbolic linguistic representation that is output by the front-end. The back-end—often referred to as the synthesizer—then converts the symbolic linguistic representation into sound. In certain systems, this part includes the computation of the target prosody (pitch contour, phoneme durations), which is then imposed on the output speech.",0,wikipedia_csai

Formant synthesis involves the use of a synthesized voice that has been pre-recorded with a set of formants, or frequency bands, that represent the different sounds in a language. Concatenative synthesis involves the use of pre-recorded speech segments that are stitched together to form the desired output.Overall, speech synthesis technology has come a long way in recent years, and the quality of synthesized speech has greatly improved.

21114,19128,"Please explain what is ""Fast Fourier transform""","A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse (mostly zero) factors. As a result, it manages to reduce the complexity of computing the DFT from O(N2){\textstyle O\left(N^{2}\right)}, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to O(Nlog⁡N){\textstyle O(N\log N)}, where N{\displaystyle N} is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where N may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of round-off error, many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple complex-number arithmetic to group theory and number theory.Fast Fourier transforms are widely used for applications in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805. In 1994, Gilbert Strang described the FFT as ""the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime"", and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the IEEE magazine Computing in Science & Engineering.The best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the factorization of N, but there are FFTs with O(N log N) complexity for all N, even for prime N. Many FFT algorithms depend only on the fact that e−2πi/N{\textstyle e^{-2\pi i/N}} is an N-th primitive root of unity, and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any finite field, such as number-theoretic transforms. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/N factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.",0,wikipedia_csai
21115,19128,"Please explain what is ""Fast Fourier transform""","The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm for efficiently computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse. The DFT is a mathematical operation that transforms a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency.The FFT is a fast and efficient algorithm for computing the DFT and is widely used in many applications, such as signal processing, image processing, and data analysis. It is based on the idea of decomposing a sequence into a sum of sinusoids, each with a different frequency and phase. The FFT takes advantage of the symmetry and periodicity properties of the DFT to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm from O(N^2) to O(N log N), where N is the length of the sequence. This makes it much faster than naive methods for computing the DFT, such as the direct computation of the DFT using the definition, which has a complexity of O(N^2).There are several different algorithms for computing the FFT, including the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, the Bluestein's algorithm, and the Prime Factor algorithm. Each of these algorithms has its own advantages and disadvantages and is best suited for different types of sequences and applications.",1,wikipedia_csai
21116,19129,"Please explain what is ""Scientific computing""","Computational science, also known as scientific computing or scientific computation (SC), is a field in mathematics that uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. It is an area of science that spans many disciplines[which? ], but at its core, it involves the development of models and simulations to understand natural systems.In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation from numerical analysis and theoretical computer science to solve problems in various scientific disciplines. The field is different from theory and laboratory experiments, which are the traditional forms of science and engineering. The scientific computing approach is to gain understanding through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers. Scientists and engineers develop computer programs and application software that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters. The essence of computational science is the application of numerical algorithms and computational mathematics. In some cases, these models require massive amounts of calculations (usually floating-point) and are often executed on supercomputers or distributed computing platforms.

21118,19135,"Please explain what is ""Software development process""","In software engineering, a software development process is a process of dividing software development work into smaller, parallel, or sequential steps or sub-processes to improve design, product management. It is also known as a software development life cycle (SDLC). The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.Most modern development processes can be vaguely described as agile. Other methodologies include waterfall, prototyping, iterative and incremental development, spiral development, rapid application development, and extreme programming.A life-cycle ""model"" is sometimes considered a more general term for a category of methodologies and a software development ""process"" a more specific term to refer to a specific process chosen by a specific organization. [citation needed] For example, there are many specific software development processes that fit the spiral life-cycle model. The field is often considered a subset of the systems development life cycle.",0,wikipedia_csai
21119,19135,"Please explain what is ""Software development process""","Software development process refers to the set of activities and procedures that software engineers follow to design, implement, test, and maintain software systems. These activities may include gathering and analyzing requirements, designing the software architecture and user interface, writing and testing code, debugging and fixing errors, and deploying and maintaining the software.There are several different approaches to software development, each with its own set of activities and procedures. Some common approaches include the Waterfall model, the Agile method, and the Spiral model.In the Waterfall model, the development process is linear and sequential, with each phase building upon the previous one. This means that the requirements must be fully defined before the design phase begins, and the design must be complete before the implementation phase can begin. This approach is well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear sense of what the final product should look like.The Agile method is a flexible, iterative approach that emphasizes rapid prototyping and ongoing collaboration between development teams and stakeholders. Agile teams work in short cycles called ""sprints,"" which allow them to rapidly develop and deliver working software.The Spiral model is a hybrid approach that combines elements of both the Waterfall model and the Agile method. It involves a series of iterative cycles, each of which includes the activities of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. This approach is well-suited for projects with high levels of uncertainty or complexity.Regardless of the approach used, the software development process is a critical part of creating high-quality software that meets the needs of users and stakeholders.",1,wikipedia_csai
21120,19138,"Please explain what is ""Punched cards""","A punched card (also punch card or punched-card) is a piece of stiff paper that holds digital data represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions. Punched cards were once common in data processing applications or to directly control automated machinery.Punched cards were widely used through much of the 20th century in the data processing industry, where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines, organized into semiautomatic data processing systems, used punched cards for data input, output, and storage. The IBM 12-row/80-column punched card format came to dominate the industry. Many early digital computers used punched cards as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.While punched cards are now obsolete as a storage medium, as of 2012, some voting machines still used punched cards to record votes. They also had a significant cultural impact.",0,wikipedia_csai
21121,19138,"Please explain what is ""Punched cards""","Punched cards were a means of storing and processing data in early computers. They were made of cardboard or paper and had rows of holes punched into them in specific patterns to represent data. Each row of holes, or card, could store a small amount of information, such as a single record or a small program.Punched cards were used primarily in the 1950s and 1960s, before the development of more advanced storage technologies such as magnetic tapes and disks. To process data stored on punched cards, a computer would read the pattern of holes on each card and perform the appropriate calculations or instructions.Punched cards were commonly used in a wide range of applications, including scientific research, business data processing, and government record keeping. They were also used to program early computers, as the holes on the cards could be used to represent instructions in a machine-readable form.Punched cards are no longer used in modern computing, as they have been replaced by more efficient and convenient storage and processing technologies.",1,wikipedia_csai
