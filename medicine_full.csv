It is definitely possible to get whiter teeth with the help of dental veneers. Firstly the procedure includes complete thorough cleaning of the stains. Coming to the cost of the procedure,there are two types of veneers. One is composite veneers which has to be done in the clinic manually by the dentist.

Based on this is possible to remove brown colour to white and how much does it cost?","It is possible to treat brown teeth due to fluoride staining by professional teeth whitening methods. The most effective method of whitening teeth that have been discolored by fluoride is through in-office bleaching, which is done by a dental professional. This method uses a stronger concentration of bleaching agents and a special light or laser to enhance the whitening process. It is typically more expensive than at-home whitening methods, but it can produce more dramatic results in a shorter period of time.Other treatment options for brown teeth due to fluoride staining include at-home bleaching kits that use lower concentrations of bleaching agents and take longer to produce results. These kits can be purchased over the counter or from a dental professional, and they generally cost less than in-office bleaching.It is important to note that teeth whitening treatments are not permanent, and the results will eventually fade over time. To maintain the whiteness of your teeth, you may need to undergo regular touch-up treatments or use at-home maintenance products, such as whitening toothpaste or mouthwash.It is also worth noting that fluoride is an important mineral that helps to protect the teeth from decay. If you are concerned about fluoride staining, you may want to speak with your dental professional about ways to reduce your exposure to fluoride, such as using a toothpaste that is low in fluoride or avoiding drinking water that has high levels of fluoride.",1,medicine

These tests may include:Ovulation testing: This involves checking for the presence of hormones that indicate ovulation, such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).Semen analysis: This involves testing a sample of your husband's semen to check the number, shape, and movement of his sperm.Hysterosalpingogram (HSG): This is an X-ray procedure that involves injecting a special dye into the uterus and fallopian tubes to check for any abnormalities or blockages.Pelvic ultrasound: This uses sound waves to create an image of the reproductive organs, which can help detect any abnormalities or problems.Endometrial biopsy: This involves taking a small sample of the lining of the uterus to check for any problems with the endometrium, which is the tissue that lines the uterus.Laparoscopy: This is a surgical procedure that involves inserting a small camera into the abdomen to check for any problems with the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries.It is important to note that the presence of pus cells in your husband's semen does not necessarily mean that he has a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Pus cells can be present for a variety of reasons, including inflammation or irritation. Your husband should discuss this issue with his healthcare provider to determine the cause of the pus cells and to determine the best course of treatment. If an STI is diagnosed, it is important that both you and your husband receive treatment to reduce the risk of transmission. After treatment, the chances of conceiving may be improved, but it is not possible to guarantee that conception will occur. It is important to continue to work with your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for you and your husband.",1,medicine

RA is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation in the joints and surrounding tissue, while rheumatism is a general term that refers to a variety of conditions that cause pain and swelling in the joints and muscles. Penidure injections are not a treatment for either condition.The main goal of treatment for RA is to reduce inflammation and prevent joint damage. This can be achieved through a combination of medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. Penicillin is not a commonly used treatment for RA.There are several different types of medications that are used to treat RA, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologics. Each of these medications has its own set of potential side effects, and it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare provider before starting any treatment.It is also important to work with a healthcare provider to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs and goals.

What do I do about improving the levels?","Serum albumin is a protein that is produced by the liver and is important for maintaining proper fluid balance in the body.

If you have liver disease or malnutrition, your healthcare provider may recommend specific treatment options to help improve your serum albumin levels. If you are taking PPIs and your serum albumin levels are low, your healthcare provider may recommend an alternative treatment for acid reflux or may suggest that you take a break from the PPIs to see if your serum albumin levels improve.It is also important to maintain a healthy diet that includes a variety of protein-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts. These foods can help your body build and repair tissues, including the proteins that make up your serum albumin.In addition, your healthcare provider may recommend supplements or medications to help improve your serum albumin levels.

It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. Symptoms of Lyme disease can include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, the infection can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system, leading to more severe symptoms.The treatment for Lyme disease typically involves the use of antibiotics. The specific antibiotic and duration of treatment will depend on the stage of the infection and the severity of the symptoms. In early stage infections, a course of oral antibiotics may be sufficient. In more severe cases or in later stages of the infection, intravenous antibiotics may be necessary.It is important to seek medical treatment as soon as possible if you suspect that you have been infected with Lyme disease. Early treatment can help to prevent the infection from spreading and can help to prevent more severe symptoms from developing.As for the range for EBV tests, the specific range can vary depending on the type of test being used and the laboratory that is conducting the test.

How to correct bedwetting of a 9 year old?Hi doctor,My child, who is 9 years old, has bedwetting problem. Please suggest me.Bedwetting, also known as nocturnal enuresis, is a common problem among children, especially those who are around 9 years old. It is important to note that bedwetting is not a behavioral issue and is often caused by a combination of factors, including a child's bladder size and the production of a hormone called vasopressin, which helps the body retain water during sleep.There are several strategies you can try to help your child stop bedwetting:Encourage your child to use the bathroom before going to bed. This can help reduce the amount of urine in the bladder and decrease the chances of bedwetting.Set a bedwetting alarm. These alarms are designed to wake your child when they start to wet the bed, allowing them to go to the bathroom and finish voiding.Limit your child's fluid intake before bedtime. Encourage your child to drink fluids earlier in the evening and avoid giving them drinks that contain caffeine, which can stimulate the bladder.Encourage your child to relax before bed. Stress and anxiety can contribute to bedwetting, so try to create a calming bedtime routine and encourage your child to relax before going to sleep.Use a bedwetting protector. These special mattress covers or pads can help protect your child's bed and make clean-up easier.It is important to be patient and understanding with your child as they work to stop bedwetting.

Lymph nodes can become swollen in response to infections, inflammation, or other conditions.Slightly swollen and tender lymph nodes in the armpit can be a normal response to minor infections, such as a cold or flu. However, persistent or large swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpit, or swelling that is accompanied by other symptoms, may be a sign of a more serious condition.It is important to pay attention to any changes in the size or consistency of your lymph nodes and to consult with a healthcare provider if you are concerned. Your healthcare provider can examine the lymph nodes and determine the cause of the swelling. They may recommend further testing, such as blood tests or imaging, to help determine the cause of the swelling.If you have a lump in your armpit that is not a swollen lymph node, it is important to have it evaluated by a healthcare provider.

Please suggest me good and effective medicines and Hair oil or hair tonic for hair loss.ThanksMina","However, it's important to note that the best treatment plan will depend on the underlying cause of your hair loss and dandruff. Therefore, it is generally recommended to consult a dermatologist or a healthcare provider to determine the cause of your hair loss and dandruff and to receive personalized treatment recommendations.Here are some potential treatment options for hair loss and dandruff:Minoxidil: Minoxidil is a topical medication that is applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth. It is available in over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription strengths.Finasteride: Finasteride is a prescription medication that is taken orally to treat male pattern hair loss. It is not approved for use in women.Dandruff shampoos: There are several dandruff shampoos available OTC that can help control dandruff. These shampoos contain active ingredients such as pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, or ketoconazole, which help to control the growth of yeast on the scalp.Topical antifungal medications: If dandruff is caused by a fungal infection, your healthcare provider may recommend a topical antifungal medication, such as miconazole or terbinafine, to be applied to the scalp.Hair oils: There are several hair oils that may help to improve the health of your scalp and hair. These include oils such as coconut oil, olive oil, and castor oil. Hair oils can be massaged into the scalp to help moisturize and nourish the hair and scalp.It's also important to address any underlying factors that may be contributing to your hair loss and dandruff, such as stress, poor nutrition, and certain medical conditions. Making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy and balanced diet, managing stress, and getting enough sleep, may also help to improve the health of your hair and scalp.",1,medicine

It does not smell foul, just unpleasant, almost like a squished insect, as bizarre as that may sound. What could be causing this, also, is is cause for concern?","It's normal for a tattoo to scab and form a protective layer over the area while it heals. However, if you're concerned about the odor or if there are any other signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or discharge, it's important to contact a healthcare professional or the tattoo artist who performed the tattoo.To help with the scabbing, you can try the following:Keep the tattoo clean: Gently wash the tattoo with mild soap and warm water twice a day. Pat the area dry with a clean towel.Apply a thin layer of moisturizer: Choose a moisturizer that is specifically formulated for tattoos or use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic lotion. Avoid using products that contain alcohol or other drying agents, as these can irritate the skin and delay healing.Protect the tattoo: Wear loose-fitting clothing to prevent the tattoo from rubbing against clothing or other surfaces. Avoid swimming and soaking the tattoo in water for at least two weeks.Avoid picking at the scabs: It's important to let the scabs fall off on their own, as picking at them can cause scarring or lead to infection.If you have any concerns or questions about the healing process, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or the tattoo artist who performed the tattoo. They can provide specific guidance and address any concerns you may have.",1,medicine

However, if you are concerned about the smell or the scabs, there are a few things you can do to help the tattoo heal properly:Keep the tattoo clean: Gently wash the tattoo with soap and water, and pat dry with a clean towel. Avoid soaking the tattoo in water, such as in the bath or shower, for the first few days.Apply moisturizer: After the tattoo has dried, apply a thin layer of unscented moisturizer to help keep the skin hydrated. Avoid using creams or ointments that contain alcohol, as these can dry out the skin and delay healing.Avoid picking at the scabs: It can be tempting to pick at the scabs, but this can cause the tattoo to heal poorly and may lead to scarring. Instead, allow the scabs to fall off naturally.Avoid exposing the tattoo to the sun: Keep the tattoo covered and out of direct sunlight until it is fully healed. Sun exposure can cause the tattoo to fade or become discolored.As for the unpleasant smell, it is possible that it is due to the scabs or the tattoo ink. If the smell is persistent and accompanied by other symptoms, such as redness or swelling, it is a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional.

Unfortunately, we were scheduled for a consult but now we have lockdown for Covid-19. I hope you can help me understand the condition of my son. Thank you.","Right bundle branch block (RBBB) and mild mitral regurgitation are two separate conditions that can be identified on an electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram (also called a ""2D Echo"").Right bundle branch block is a type of heart rhythm disorder that occurs when there is a problem with the electrical signals in the heart. Specifically, the right bundle branch, which is a group of fibers in the heart that carries electrical signals to the right ventricle, is not functioning properly. This can cause the heart to beat in an abnormal pattern and may lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath or fatigue. RBBB is usually not a serious condition, but it may require further evaluation to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.Mild mitral regurgitation is a type of heart valve disorder that occurs when the mitral valve, which is located between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart, is not closing properly. This can cause blood to flow backwards into the left atrium during each heartbeat, a condition called regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation is generally not a serious condition, but it may require further evaluation to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.It is important to note that the information provided here is general in nature and should not be used to diagnose or treat any specific medical condition. If you have concerns about your son's health, it is important to discuss them with his cardiologist or another healthcare professional.",1,medicine

Thank you.","Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a type of heart block that occurs when there is a delay or obstruction in the electrical signals that coordinate the contraction of the right side of the heart. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including scarring of the heart tissue, inflammation, or abnormalities in the heart's structure.Mild mitral regurgitation (MR) refers to a condition in which the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart, does not close properly. As a result, some of the blood that has been pumped from the left ventricle leaks back into the left atrium, instead of being pumped out to the rest of the body. Mild MR is generally considered to be a mild form of the condition, in which the leakage of blood is minimal.It is important to note that the presence of RBBB and mild MR does not necessarily mean that your son has a serious heart condition. However, it is important to follow up with your cardiologist and undergo any recommended tests or procedures to determine the cause and appropriate treatment, if necessary. It is also important for your son to continue to follow a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a healthy diet, and avoiding tobacco and excess alcohol, to support the health of his heart.",1,medicine

However, it is important to have a healthcare provider evaluate any significant differences in testicle size, as it could be a sign of a medical condition. Some potential causes of a testicle being larger in an infant include:Undescended testicle: An undescended testicle is a testicle that has not moved down into the scrotum. This is a common condition in infants, and it usually resolves on its own within the first few months of life. However, if the testicle does not descend by the time the child is six months old, surgery may be needed to move it into the scrotum.Hernia: A hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents through a weakness in the abdominal wall. In infants, a hernia may cause a testicle to appear larger than normal. Hernias can be repaired surgically.Testicular torsion: Testicular torsion is a condition in which the testicle becomes twisted, cutting off its blood supply.

I read that staying clean and drinking a lot of water or cranberry juice will help flush it out.

This pain is triggered only after playing frisbee. What do I do?","It's important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing pain that persists or worsens despite taking rest and trying self-care measures. A posterior tibial stress fracture is a type of fracture that occurs in the bone that runs along the inside of the lower leg (the tibia). This type of fracture is often caused by overuse or repetitive stress on the bone, which can occur during activities such as running or playing sports.If you think you may have a posterior tibial stress fracture, it's important to stop participating in activities that may be causing the fracture to worsen and to seek medical attention. Your doctor can examine you and order imaging tests, such as an x-ray or MRI, to determine the extent of the fracture and recommend the appropriate treatment. Treatment for a posterior tibial stress fracture may include rest, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery.In the meantime, you can try the following self-care measures to help manage the pain and reduce the risk of further injury:Rest: It's important to rest the affected leg and avoid activities that may cause further stress on the bone.Ice: Applying an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time can help reduce inflammation and numb the area to provide pain relief.Compression: Wearing a compression bandage or sleeve can help reduce swelling and provide support to the affected area.Elevation: Elevating the affected leg above the level of your heart can help reduce swelling.Over-the-counter pain medication: Taking over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help reduce inflammation and manage pain.It's important to follow your doctor's recommendations for treatment and to seek medical attention if you experience any worsening of symptoms or if the pain does not improve with self-care measures.",1,medicine

The goals of treatment are to slow the growth of skin cells, reduce inflammation, and alleviate symptoms such as itching, redness, and scaling. Treatment options for psoriasis include topical medications, light therapy, and oral or injectable medications. The specific treatment plan will depend on the type and severity of the psoriasis, as well as the individual's preference and overall health.Topical medications, which are applied to the skin, include corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, and topical retinoids. These medications can help to reduce inflammation and slow the growth of skin cells. Light therapy, also known as phototherapy, involves exposing the skin to controlled amounts of natural or artificial light. This can help to reduce inflammation and slow the growth of skin cells.Oral or injectable medications, also known as systemic therapies, are taken by mouth or injected into the body. These include medications such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and biologics. Biologics are a newer type of medication that targets specific parts of the immune system. These medications can be effective, but they can also have serious side effects, so they are usually reserved for more severe cases of psoriasis or when other treatments have not been successful.It is important to work closely with a dermatologist or other healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for you or your loved one.

I dont break out in a prickly heat rash more of a bluish tinge.  The medical surgery in that country then administers a steroid injection.What can I do to prevent this happening before I go on holiday.  It has been suggested that I take beta carotene.  Is this a good idea?  Many thanks","It is not clear whether taking beta carotene can help prevent an allergic reaction to heat.

It is an antioxidant that may have some health benefits, but there is limited evidence to support its use for preventing allergic reactions.If you have a history of allergic reactions to heat and are planning to travel to a hot country, it is important to take precautions to prevent a reaction. Some things you can do include:Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, especially in hot and humid conditions.Wear loose, lightweight clothing that covers your skin to protect it from the sun.Use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays.Avoid strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day.Stay in air-conditioned or well-ventilated areas as much as possible.If you are concerned about your allergic reaction to heat, it is a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before you travel.

Follicle monitoring done on 11 january shows follicle of size 18mm but endometrial thickness is just 5.7mm. Is this the side effect of fertyl. Will progynova 2mg help solve the problem. Last menstruation period date was 3 january.","Hallow, Fertyl is clomiphene citrate. It is basically used for egg release (ovulation) where natural ovulation is a problem. It is in particular useful in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome where the follicles are maturing to varied extent and still the ovulation failure is noted. Clomiphene citrate is also having antioestrogenic effect. So it may hamper  growth of endometrium. Hence, in women where Endometrial growth is low, gonadotropin hormones may be preferred for induction of ovulation. Endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm has proved to be most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum or blastocyst. Ovulation occurring when endometrium is just 5.7 mm is likely to end in 'no pregnancy'.So long as the follicular size is concerned, it has been reported for many decades that the ova discharged from the follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm are the healthiest one and give maximum fertilization rate and continuation of pregnancy success rate. Progynova is a synthetic hormone replacement for oestrogen. It is used to build up the lining of the uterus in preparation for embryo transfer during a thaw cycle for women who do not ovulate regularly. However, you should not wait for the ovulation beyond the follicular size more than 21 mm. If it takes longer for the endometrium to grow, you may waste this cycle and start Progynova earlier in next cycle and have ovulation at proper follicular size. I hope this information is useful to you for further decisions. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri",0,medicine

Scaling is a procedure that removes plaque and tartar from the surface of the teeth, and it can be performed by a dentist or dental hygienist. However, it's important to understand that scaling is not always the solution for yellow teeth. There are a number of other factors that can cause teeth to turn yellow, such as:Aging: As we get older, our teeth naturally become less white due to wear and tear and exposure to staining agents like coffee, tea, and tobacco.Medications: Some medications, such as tetracycline, can cause tooth discoloration.Poor oral hygiene: Poor oral hygiene can lead to a build-up of plaque and tartar on the teeth, which can cause them to turn yellow.Trauma: Teeth can become discolored if they have been traumatized, such as by a blow to the mouth.If you have yellow teeth, it's important to visit a dentist to determine the cause and the best course of treatment.

He is an 8 mos old.","Tropozoites are a stage in the life cycle of some parasites, specifically those that belong to the Plasmodium species, which cause malaria. If tropozoites are seen in a fecal examination, it means that the person being tested is infected with a parasitic infection.Pus cells, also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMNLs, are a type of white blood cell that is involved in the immune response to infections. The presence of 2-4 pus cells per high power field (hpf) in a fecal examination suggests that there is some inflammation or infection present in the gastrointestinal tract.Red blood cells (RBCs) in the stool can indicate bleeding in the digestive tract. TNTC stands for ""too numerous to count,"" which means that there are so many RBCs present that it is not possible to accurately count them. This can be a sign of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.Overall, the results of the fecal examination suggest that your 8-month-old son has a parasitic infection and some inflammation or infection in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as possible bleeding.

An eye doctor can recommend the best glasses for your needs, taking into account your individual vision prescription and any other factors that may be contributing to your eye discomfort.In addition to using specialized computer glasses, there are a few other things you can do to reduce eye strain and discomfort while working on a laptop:Take frequent breaks: Make sure to take breaks from looking at your screen every 20 minutes or so. Close your eyes for a few seconds or look away from the screen and focus on something in the distance.Blink frequently: Blinking helps to moisten and refresh your eyes, which can help reduce dryness and discomfort.Adjust your screen: Make sure your screen is at a comfortable distance and angle, and adjust the brightness and contrast to a level that is comfortable for you.Use proper lighting: Avoid working in a room with bright or harsh lighting, as this can contribute to eye strain. Instead, try to work in a room with softer, indirect lighting.Use a humidifier: Dry air can contribute to eye dryness and discomfort.

However, it's important to note that IRBBB is a relatively common finding on an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and is often benign, meaning it is not a serious or life-threatening condition.IRBBB is a type of heart rhythm abnormality that occurs when the electrical signals that coordinate the contraction of the heart's muscle are disrupted. This can cause the heart to beat less efficiently and may lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. However, many people with IRBBB have no symptoms at all and live normal, active lives.It's always important to follow your doctor's recommendations and to have regular check-ups to monitor your son's heart health. In the meantime, it's generally safe for your son to continue participating in sports and other physical activities as long as he feels comfortable doing so. If he experiences any unusual symptoms while exercising, such as shortness of breath or chest pain, he should stop immediately and consult with a doctor.",1,medicine

It's important to take proper care of your tattoo to prevent complications.To alleviate the symptoms and help your tattoo heal properly, you should follow these steps:Keep the tattoo clean and dry. Gently wash the tattoo with soap and water, then pat it dry with a clean towel. Avoid soaking the tattoo in water, such as in the bath or shower, for the first week after getting it.Apply a thin layer of fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer to the tattoo.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help reduce inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can often be effective in relieving mild to moderate headaches. More severe headaches may require prescription medications or other treatments. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific headache.Jaw pain: Jaw pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including teeth grinding, jaw injury, or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the jaw pain. In some cases, over-the-counter pain relievers or ice packs can help reduce inflammation and relieve discomfort. Other treatments may include physical therapy, bite guards, or medication to relax the muscles in the jaw.Low blood pressure: Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions.

There is ongoing debate about the safety of amalgam fillings, with some concerns about the potential health effects of the mercury they contain. However, the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence suggests that amalgam fillings are safe and do not pose a significant health risk when used in dental restorations.If you are concerned about the potential health effects of your amalgam fillings and are considering having them removed, it is important to consult with a qualified dental professional. The process of removing amalgam fillings can release small amounts of mercury vapor, which can be inhaled. However, proper safety measures can be taken to minimize the release of mercury vapor during the removal process.Your dentist should use appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to mercury vapor during the removal process, such as using a high-volume evacuation system to remove the vapor, providing a rubber dam to isolate the tooth being worked on, and using a cold water spray to minimize the release of vapor. In addition, your dentist should provide you with a mouthguard to wear during the procedure to protect your oral tissues and reduce the amount of vapor you inhale.It is also important to keep in mind that the removal of amalgam fillings carries some risks, such as the possibility of damaging the tooth or surrounding tissues. Therefore, it is important to carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of amalgam removal with your dentist before making a decision.",1,medicine

In most cases, nosebleeds are benign and can be easily treated at home. Here are some suggestions for treatment:Encourage your child to sit upright and lean slightly forward to help prevent blood from flowing down the back of the throat.Have your child pinch the soft part of the nose closed with their thumb and index finger, and hold this position for at least 5-10 minutes.If the bleeding does not stop after 10-15 minutes, you may apply a cold compress or ice pack to the bridge of the nose to help constrict the blood vessels and stop the bleeding.If the bleeding continues, or if your child experiences frequent or recurrent nosebleeds, it may be helpful to use a saline nasal spray or apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the inside of the nostrils to keep the nasal passages moist and prevent drying and cracking.If the nosebleeds are severe or recurrent, it may be necessary to see a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.It is not uncommon for children to experience episodic nosebleeds, especially during cold and flu season.

There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction in the brain parenchyma. There is a mildly prominent CSF overlying the cerebral hemispheres secondary to moderate generalized cerebral and cerebellar volume loss rathat than subdural hygromas. The ventricles and basilar cisterns are normal in size.,"An MRI of the brain is a medical imaging test that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain. The report you provided describes several findings on the MRI scan.A lacunar infarct is a type of small stroke that occurs when a small blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked, disrupting blood flow to a small area of brain tissue. The presence of a small chronic lacunar infarct means that there is a small area of brain tissue that has been damaged due to a previous stroke.A dilated perivascular space is a small fluid-filled area around a blood vessel in the brain. The presence of a dilated perivascular space in the posterior left centrum semiolale suggests that there may be some swelling or inflammation in this area of the brain.The MRI report also mentions a small chronic lacunar infarct in the left thalamus, which is an area of the brain involved in movement, sensory processing, and regulation of sleep and wakefulness.The report states that there is no evidence of restricted diffusion, which means that the MRI did not detect any areas of the brain that are experiencing a sudden lack of blood flow, which can occur during an acute stroke.The report mentions that there is a mildly prominent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overlying the cerebral hemispheres, which may be due to moderate generalized cerebral and cerebellar volume loss. This means that there is an abnormal amount of CSF present in the brain, which may be due to a decrease in the volume of brain tissue.The ventricles and basilar cisterns, which are fluid-filled spaces within the brain, are described as being normal in size.Overall, the MRI report suggests that there are some areas of brain tissue damage and swelling present, but no evidence of an acute stroke or other serious brain injury. It is important to note that this interpretation is based on the information provided in the report and a complete evaluation of the MRI scan would require a more detailed review by a healthcare professional.",1,medicine

Chewing tobacco, including gutka, is a major risk factor for developing submucous fibrosis.Treatment for submucous fibrosis typically involves a combination of approaches, including:Stopping the use of tobacco and other substances that may be causing or contributing to the condition.

While pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme that can break down proteins, there is no scientific evidence to support its use as a treatment for submucous fibrosis or any other condition.

These may include:Blood tests: These tests can help determine if there is any inflammation or infection in the body.Electrocardiogram (ECG): This test measures the electrical activity of the heart and can help identify any potential issues with the heart's rhythm.Stress test: This test involves exercising on a treadmill or stationary bike while being monitored by a healthcare professional. It can help determine how well the heart is functioning during physical activity.Echocardiogram: This test uses sound waves to create a detailed image of the heart.

A positive HBsAg test result means that you are infected with the hepatitis B virus and can transmit the virus to others.Treatment for HBsAg positive individuals typically involves taking antiviral medications to suppress the virus and prevent liver damage. The specific antiviral medication and treatment plan will depend on several factors, including the stage of your infection, your overall health, and whether you have any underlying liver conditions.It is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for you. In some cases, treatment may be able to clear the virus from your body and lead to a sustained virologic response (SVR), meaning that the virus is no longer detectable in your blood. However, in other cases, the virus may persist and treatment may be necessary to manage the infection.It is also important to practice safe behaviors to prevent the transmission of the hepatitis B virus to others. This includes avoiding sharing needles or other injection equipment, practicing safe sex, and washing your hands regularly.I hope this information is helpful.

She loves to go to the daycare and is happy there. She eats well on weekends or other days when she is there at home. I send the same food to her as I feed her at home.,"There can be a number of reasons why a child may not eat while at daycare. Here are a few possibilities:Stress or anxiety: Being in a new environment with unfamiliar people and routines can be stressful for young children. This stress may cause them to lose their appetite.Distractions: Children may be more easily distracted at daycare, especially if there are other children present. This can make it harder for them to focus on eating.Different routines: Children may be more used to eating at certain times or in certain ways at home. At daycare, the routines may be different, which can make it harder for them to eat.Changes in appetite: Children's appetites can vary from day to day, and it's common for them to eat more on some days and less on others.It's important to talk to your child's daycare provider about your concerns and see if they have any suggestions or observations about your child's eating habits. It may also be helpful to try to pack foods that are familiar to your child and that you know they enjoy, and to provide positive reinforcement for eating, such as praising your child for trying new foods or for eating a good meal.",1,medicine

However, if you are concerned about the risk of infection, you may want to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider.",1,medicine

These foods are high in fiber, which can help slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream.Exercising regularly: Physical activity can help lower blood sugar levels by increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking or cycling, most days of the week.Losing excess weight: Carrying excess weight, especially around the waist, can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing weight through diet and exercise can help lower blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of developing diabetes.Reducing stress: High levels of stress can lead to an increase in blood sugar levels. Try practicing stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing to help keep blood sugar levels in check.Getting enough sleep: Lack of sleep can disrupt the body's natural balance of hormones and lead to an increase in blood sugar levels. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help keep blood sugar levels stable.It is not possible for me to determine whether your blood sugar levels are normal or indicative of prediabetes without more information about your overall health and medical history.

I have a lot of pain in my feet, and cannot do much walking, but job involves standing a lot. Would you kindly advise me on this. Regards Rochan","Osteophytic lipping is a condition where bony outgrowths, called osteophytes, form on the edges of bones in the joints. These outgrowths can cause pain and discomfort, as well as restrict movement. Osteophytes can form in response to wear and tear on the joint, or as a result of other underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.Surgery to remove osteophytes may be recommended if non-surgical treatments, such as physical therapy and medications, have not been effective in relieving pain and improving function. The decision to have surgery should be based on a thorough evaluation by a doctor, and should take into consideration the severity of the condition, the potential risks and benefits of the surgery, and the patient's individual needs and preferences.If you are considering surgery, it is important to discuss your options with your doctor and to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits.

If the above situation happens at three or four places on his body simultaneously by an HIV-infected mosquito, what is the possibility of HIV transmission by this method?There is no risk of HIV transmission through mosquitoes. HIV is a virus that affects humans and other primates, and it cannot replicate or survive in the bodies of insects such as mosquitoes. Mosquitoes do not transmit HIV when they bite humans.In fact, HIV cannot survive outside the body for very long. The virus is fragile and is easily damaged by exposure to air, heat, and light. Therefore, it is not possible for HIV to be transmitted through mosquitoes or any other type of insect.It is important to note that HIV is primarily transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. The most common ways to contract HIV are through sexual contact, sharing needles, and mother-to-child transmission during childbirth or breastfeeding.

But when I stop using it, the melasma increases. It becomes more darken on cheeks and nose. Please suggest any medicine to get rid of these ugly spots.Melasma is a common skin condition that causes brown or gray-brown patches, usually on the face. It is more common in women, but it can also affect men. Melasma can be difficult to treat and may require a combination of treatments to be effective.Here are some steps you can take to help reduce the appearance of melasma:Wear sunscreen: It is important to protect your skin from the sun, as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light can worsen melasma. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it to your face and other exposed skin every day.Avoid certain triggers: Certain things can trigger or worsen melasma, such as certain skin care products, hormones (including birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy), and certain medications. Try to identify any potential triggers and avoid them if possible.Use lightening agents: Several topical lightening agents are available that can help to lighten the appearance of melasma. These include hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojic acid, and vitamin C. These agents can be used alone or in combination with other treatments.Consider chemical peels: Chemical peels can help to remove the top layers of skin, revealing brighter, smoother skin underneath. This can help to improve the appearance of melasma.Try laser therapy: Laser therapy can help to improve the appearance of melasma by targeting the pigmented cells in the skin.It is important to speak with a dermatologist about the best treatment options for your specific case of melasma. A dermatologist can help to determine the best course of treatment for you, which may include a combination of the above treatments.",1,medicine

Breast symptoms: Engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in areolar size, Montgomery's tubercles under areola and secretions from the nipples.

After a root canal procedure, a crown (also called a cap) is often placed on the tooth to protect it and restore it to its normal function. The life expectancy of a root canal treated and crowned tooth can vary, but with proper care and maintenance, it can last for many years.It is important to maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly and visiting your dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanings. This can help to extend the life of your root canal treated tooth. In some cases, a root canal treated tooth may fail despite good oral hygiene and regular dental care. If this occurs, there are several options that may be considered, including:Retreatment: In some cases, it may be possible to perform another root canal procedure to try to save the tooth.Endodontic surgery: If the root canal treatment was not successful or the tooth has become infected again, a surgical procedure called an apicoectomy (also known as root-end resection) may be recommended to remove the infected tissue at the tip of the root and seal the end of the root canal.Tooth extraction: If the tooth cannot be saved, it may need to be extracted.

56934,23994,What causes hard lumps behind right ear and near base of head?Hi my 2 y/o daughter has a dime size hard lump behind her right ear and another one a few inches away at the base of her head -- what could this be?  They don't seem to bother her.  I have not noticed them before.  They are flesh tone and she has not shown any other symptoms that I can tell.,"There are several possible causes for hard lumps behind the ear and at the base of the head. It is important to have a medical professional examine your daughter and determine the specific cause of the lumps. Here are a few possibilities:Lymph nodes: Lumps in this area may be swollen lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are part of the body's immune system and can become swollen in response to infection or inflammation.Cysts: Cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop anywhere in the body. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, injury, or infection.Lipomas: Lipomas are benign (non-cancerous) tumors made up of fat cells. They are usually soft and can move slightly under the skin.Abscesses: An abscess is a collection of pus that can form anywhere in the body in response to infection or inflammation. Abscesses can be painful and may need to be drained.It is important to have a medical professional examine the lumps and determine the cause so that appropriate treatment can be provided if necessary. If the lumps are causing your daughter discomfort or if you are concerned about their appearance, it is a good idea to have them checked out by a doctor.",1,medicine

However, there are a few possible explanations for the symptoms you have described.One possibility is endometriosis, a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) grows outside the uterus, causing pain and sometimes fertility problems. Other possibilities could include ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).It is important to see a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can perform a physical examination, order appropriate tests, and discuss treatment options with you. In the meantime, it may be helpful to keep a symptom diary to help you and your healthcare provider track the pattern and severity of your symptoms.",1,medicine

In what way Paternia and Wysolone helps in my case?,"It is not appropriate for me to provide specific medical advice or recommend specific treatment for your specific health concerns. I recommend that you discuss your specific health concerns and treatment options with a healthcare provider.Paternia and Wysolone are both medications that have different uses and potential side effects. Paternia is a brand name for the medication progesterone, which is a hormone that is involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. It is not clear how progesterone might be used to treat infertility or low sperm count. Wysolone is a brand name for the medication prednisolone, which is a corticosteroid that is used to treat a wide range of conditions, including inflammation, allergic reactions, and autoimmune disorders. It is not clear how prednisolone might be used to treat infertility or low sperm count.It is important to note that infertility can be caused by a variety of factors, and treatment will depend on the specific cause of the infertility. Some potential causes of infertility in men include low sperm count, problems with sperm motility (movement), structural abnormalities of the reproductive system, hormonal imbalances, and certain medical conditions or medications. Treatment options may include medications, lifestyle changes, or assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).Again, I recommend that you discuss your specific health concerns and treatment options with a healthcare provider.

A positive PCR result for M. tuberculosis means that the bacterium was detected in the sample.If you have been diagnosed with AFB negative but PCR for M.tuberculosis positive, it means that the AFB test did not detect the presence of AFB in your sample, but the PCR test did detect the presence of M. tuberculosis DNA. This suggests that you may have a TB infection. It is important to follow the treatment recommendations of your healthcare provider in order to properly treat the infection and prevent it from spreading to others.It is also important to note that TB can be a serious illness, and it is important to receive proper treatment in order to fully recover. If you have any concerns about your diagnosis or treatment, it is always a good idea to discuss them with your healthcare provider.As for your ability to conceive, it is not uncommon for people with TB to have fertility problems, but this can depend on a variety of factors, including the severity of the infection and the type of treatment that is needed. It is important to discuss any concerns you have about fertility with your healthcare provider. They will be able to provide you with more specific information and guidance based on your individual situation.",1,medicine

It is characterized by obsessions, which are unwanted and intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that cause anxiety or distress, and compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession.Treatment for OCD often involves a combination of medications and therapy. Fluoxetine, which is a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is often used to treat OCD. SSRIs work by increasing the levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that is involved in mood and behavior.While there is no known ""cure"" for OCD, treatment can be very effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. It is important to work with a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, to determine the best treatment plan for you. Therapy options for OCD include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP), which have been shown to be effective in treating OCD.It is not uncommon for people with OCD to need long-term treatment to manage their symptoms. However, it is possible for some people to eventually taper off or stop taking medication or to reduce the frequency of therapy sessions.

Regards Ammu","Daydreaming can be a normal and even helpful activity, but if it is interfering with your ability to focus and complete tasks, there are some strategies you can try to help you better control it. Here are a few suggestions:Identify the triggers: Try to notice what situations or activities tend to trigger your daydreaming, and try to minimize or eliminate those triggers as much as possible. For example, if you tend to daydream while sitting in a boring lecture, try to find ways to make the lecture more engaging or break it up with breaks or other activities.Set specific goals and deadlines: Having clear goals and deadlines can help you stay focused and motivated, and can make it less tempting to daydream.Practice mindfulness: Paying attention to the present moment can help you stay grounded and focused. Try incorporating mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, into your daily routine.Find an activity that engages you: If you find yourself daydreaming when you're feeling bored or unengaged, try finding an activity that fully engages your mind and attention. This could be a hobby, a puzzle, or even just a challenging task.Seek support: If you're finding it difficult to control your daydreaming on your own, consider seeking support from a mental health professional or a trusted friend or family member. They can help you identify any underlying issues that may be contributing to your daydreaming and develop strategies to manage it.",1,medicine

If your neighbor was bitten by a dog that was fully immunized against rabies and the bite occurred within the past 15 days, it is likely that the healthcare professional is following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies.According to the WHO, PEP for rabies consists of administering a course of rabies vaccine and providing passive immunization with rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). The rabies vaccine is given in a series of doses over a period of several weeks, and the RIG is given as a single dose at the time of the first vaccine dose.If the dog that bit your neighbor was fully immunized against rabies and the bite occurred within the past 15 days, it is likely that the healthcare professional is following the recommendations of the WHO for PEP for rabies. In this case, it is important for your neighbor to complete the full course of rabies vaccine and to also receive the RIG as advised by the healthcare professional. It is not appropriate to rely solely on the rabies vaccine without also receiving the RIG, as the RIG provides immediate protection against the rabies virus while the vaccine takes several weeks to become effective.If your neighbor has concerns about the recommended treatment plan, it is important for her to discuss them with the healthcare professional who is treating her.

Could it be anything else? he has a history of unprotected sex as well with multiple partners","Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV: HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 is typically associated with oral herpes, which causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth, but it can also cause genital herpes. HSV-2 is usually the cause of genital herpes, but it can also cause oral herpes.It is possible for someone to have herpes and not be aware of it, as the virus can cause symptoms that are mild or may not even be noticed. It is also possible for someone to have the virus and not experience any symptoms at all.If you are concerned that you or your boyfriend may have herpes, it is important to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation and testing. The growth that you described on your boyfriend's penis may be related to herpes, but it could also be caused by something else. Only a healthcare provider can give you a definitive diagnosis.In the meantime, it is important to practice safe sex to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to your partner or acquiring it from a partner. This includes using condoms or dental dams during sexual activity and avoiding sexual contact when symptoms are present. It is also a good idea to talk to your partner about their sexual history and whether they have been tested for STIs, including herpes.",1,medicine

Now i feel that my front teeth are shifting forward from the root! What is the best way to correct them. I dont want braces again. Thanks","It's natural for teeth to shift over time, especially if you are no longer wearing retainers. If your front teeth have shifted significantly and you are unhappy with the way they look, there are a few options that you could consider to correct their position:Orthodontic treatment: This may involve wearing braces or aligners to gently guide your teeth back into position. This is usually the most effective way to correct misaligned teeth, but it can be time-consuming and may not be the most convenient option for you.Bonding: If your teeth have only shifted slightly, you may be able to correct their position using dental bonding. This involves applying a composite resin material to your teeth and sculpting it into the desired shape. Bonding can be completed in a single office visit, but it may not be as durable as other treatment options.Veneers: If you want to make more significant changes to the appearance of your front teeth, you may want to consider veneers. Veneers are thin shells that are applied to the front of your teeth and can be used to correct misalignment, as well as other cosmetic issues. Veneers are more expensive than bonding and require more than one office visit to complete.It's important to consult with a dentist or orthodontist to determine the best course of treatment for your specific needs. They can help you weigh the pros and cons of each option and choose the one that will be most effective and appropriate for you.",1,medicine

This type of fracture is considered a medical emergency because it carries a higher risk of infection.The treatment for a compound fracture typically involves the following steps:Control bleeding: If the bone has punctured the skin, there may be significant bleeding. The first priority is to control the bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound and elevating the injured limb above heart level, if possible.Administer pain medication: The patient will likely be given pain medication to help manage the pain associated with the fracture.Clean the wound: The wound will need to be thoroughly cleaned to reduce the risk of infection. This may involve using a sterile solution or irrigation to clean out any debris or dirt.Set the bone: Once the wound has been cleaned and the bleeding has been controlled, the bone will need to be set back into place. This may be done using traction, splinting, or surgery.Close the wound: If the wound is small, it may be closed using sutures (stitches). If the wound is larger or if there is significant tissue damage, the wound may need to be left open and allowed to heal on its own.Rehabilitation: After the bone has been set and the wound has been closed, the patient will likely need to undergo physical therapy to help restore strength and mobility to the injured limb.It's important to seek medical treatment as soon as possible for a compound fracture. If left untreated, this type of fracture can lead to serious complications, such as infection, nerve damage, or amputation.",1,medicine

This blockage can be caused by a clot in one of the coronary arteries that supplies blood to the heart. If the blockage is not promptly treated, it can lead to damage or death of the heart muscle tissue in the affected area, known as a myocardial infarction or heart attack.If an ECG shows evidence of an anteroseptal infarct on several different occasions and an echocardiogram shows a thickened septal area, it is highly likely that the anteroseptal infarct actually occurred. It is not uncommon for people who have had a heart attack to experience recurrent symptoms or ECG changes, as the damage to the heart muscle may not be fully reversible.It is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms that may be related to a heart attack, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or discomfort in the neck, jaw, arms, or back.

In some cases, it may not be possible to restore fertility, but there are still options for starting a family, such as adoption or surrogacy.It is also worth noting that erectile dysfunction, or difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection, can be a sign of underlying health issues and should be addressed with a healthcare professional.

This has been going on for 5 months now and I am beginning to despair that I shall ever get better,"There are several possible causes of a recurrent cough and a sensation of smoke while breathing.

Four weeks later still have some cough and congestion and seems to have settled into Bronchitis. Would a round of Prednisone help to clear this all the way up? Thank you, Rob","Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication that can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including respiratory conditions such as cough and bronchitis. It can be effective in reducing inflammation in the airways and may help to relieve symptoms such as cough and congestion. However, prednisone is not a first-line treatment for bronchitis and is usually only used in cases where other treatments have not been effective.It's important to keep in mind that prednisone can have significant side effects and should be used only under the guidance of a healthcare provider. If you are experiencing symptoms of bronchitis, it's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can determine the most appropriate treatment based on the specific cause of your symptoms and your overall health. In the meantime, you can try some self-care measures such as getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and using over-the-counter cough and cold medications to help relieve your symptoms.",1,medicine

The redness also goes away then comes back and my feet and palms itch. The circles and lines look really scary, like crop circles or something","Hi. Is this the first episode or do you have a previous history of allergies in the past. Try and recall any possible cause of the rash. Any history of outdoor activity, exposure to plants, dust, animals, chemicals, any medication , any particular food. Anything you have been allergic to in the past?Once you can narrow down the possible factor, you will have to avoid it or you will keep having similar reactions. Seeing circles and lines, either white or reddish wherever you apply pressure, or scratch, is called dermographism and is a sign of sensitivity and high allergy levels in blood. So do consult a doctor regarding tests for the blood levels of eosinophils, serum IgE etc, which can show allergy. Skin tests can also be done to check specific reactions.Very rarely this reaction can happen even in normal skin.Apply a menthol/calamine lotion for the itching, 2-3 times a day. Start an antihistamine daily for 5-7 days after consulting the dermatologist. This can help bring the allergy levels in control.If it is severe or persistent, you may be advised a cortisone shot in the ER.Use a mild soap for washing, avoid harsh chemicals. In case you have severe swelling, puffiness of face, lips, difficulty breathing, etc go to the ER immediately.Hope this helps guide you.

It is often caused by poor oral hygiene, such as not brushing your teeth regularly or using tobacco products.Trauma: If you have been playing with the area or if it has been injured in some way, it could be causing the bleeding and soreness.Mouth sores: Certain types of mouth sores, such as canker sores or herpes simplex virus, can cause red spots on the gums that are sore and may bleed.Other conditions: There are other conditions that can cause red spots on the gums, such as allergies, hormonal changes, or certain medications.It is important to see a dentist or oral health professional to determine the cause of the red spot on your gum.

These may include scarring or inflammation of the bile duct, abnormal growths or tumors, or the formation of stones or other debris within the bile duct. In some cases, the bile duct may be naturally narrow or have a congenital abnormality that makes it prone to narrowing.It is not uncommon for the bile duct to narrow following ERCP, especially if the procedure was performed to remove stones or other debris from the duct. The bile duct may also narrow as a result of inflammation or scarring that occurs during the procedure. In some cases, the bile duct may narrow due to the formation of new stones or debris following the procedure.The minimum size of the bile duct that is considered normal can vary, but in general, the bile duct should be at least 6-8 mm in diameter.

My thumb does not hurt when I move it, it is predominantly the outside of the wrist where the bone sticks out normally that hurts. I had it x-rayed but the radiologist found no fracture. I still believe there something to be wrong, any advice would be appreciated.","It's possible that you have a wrist sprain or strain, or even a ligament injury, if you're experiencing pain and difficulty moving your wrist after an injury. Sprains and strains occur when the ligaments or muscles in the wrist are stretched or torn, and they can be quite painful. Ligament injuries can also cause pain and difficulty moving the wrist. It's important to see a doctor or a physical therapist for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. They may recommend rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain medication to help reduce inflammation and pain. They may also recommend physical therapy exercises to help improve strength and mobility in the wrist. If the pain persists or becomes worse, it's important to follow up with a medical professional for further evaluation and treatment.",1,medicine

So I wanted to know that is there anything in ayurvedy or homeopathy to rule out the same completely My mail id is YYYY@YYYY,"Nephrotic syndrome is a medical condition that affects the kidneys and can cause protein to leak from the kidneys into the urine. It can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, such as kidney damage, inflammation, or immune system disorders.In Ayurveda, nephrotic syndrome is known as ""Mutraghata"" and is believed to be caused by an imbalance of the three doshas (vata, pitta, and kapha) in the body. Ayurvedic treatment for nephrotic syndrome typically involves the use of herbs, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications to address the underlying imbalances and support kidney function. Some common herbs used in Ayurvedic treatment of nephrotic syndrome include Gokshura, Varun, Punarnava, and Shirish.It is important to note that Ayurvedic treatment is not a substitute for conventional medical treatment and should be used in conjunction with, not instead of, standard medical care. If your child has been diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, it is important to work closely with a qualified healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.As for the question of whether nephrotic syndrome can be completely cured, the answer is not straightforward. In some cases, nephrotic syndrome can be effectively managed and the symptoms controlled with appropriate treatment. However, in other cases, the condition may recur or persist despite treatment. The likelihood of a complete cure and the risk of relapse can depend on a variety of factors, including the underlying cause of the condition, the severity of the kidney damage, and the individual's response to treatment.It is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan for your child and to monitor their progress. If you have any concerns or questions about your child's condition or treatment, it is important to discuss them with your healthcare provider.",1,medicine

Kindly suggest the treatment.","Hello. Well, but it depends on many factors such as the mid-parental height, ethnicity, nutritional status, etc. Since he is below the third percentile for age for boys for height, I would suggest a proper work-up to rule out hormonal deficiencies such as, 1. Thyroid function test. 2. IGF-1 (insluin-growth fractor) and IGFBP-3 (insulin-like growth fractor binding protein). 3. LH (leutinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) routine tests like CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation arte). 4. Liver function test. 5. Renal function test.6. Urinalysis, and X-ray of left hand and wrist. If the hormone analysis comes out abnormal or in other words, there is a deficiency of any of the above hormones, and then I would suggest MRI pituitary gland. Because short constitutional stature is not a disorder but a variation in normal growth, therefore, medical treatment is not usually necessary.So I would not suggest any hormonal treatment as it will not benefit him at this age as his bones have matured by now. Although some studies do suggest the use of testosterone injections or patches to achieve growth and sexual maturation if necessary. Growth hormone is not recommended if any of the above tests turn out to be normal as it is associated with a lot of adverse effects. I hope my advice is of some benefit to you.",0,medicine

While GH can help to stimulate growth in children and adolescents, it is generally not effective for increasing adult height.Human growth hormone is usually prescribed for children and adolescents who are growth hormone deficient, or who have certain other medical conditions that affect growth. It is not usually prescribed for the purpose of increasing adult height.If your son is interested in increasing his height, it is important to first determine the cause of his current height. There are several factors that can affect growth and development, including genetics, nutrition, and medical conditions.

Since then, my period has been very light and lasts only a day. I had an abortion earlier too using the same method and did not experience anything as such. What could be the problem? What do you advise for this?","Hi. The symptoms you described indicate that it is due to either estrogen deficiency or a condition called Asherman's syndrome (adhesion or fibrosis of the endometrium after dilation and curettage). Though this is uncommon after an abortion by suction method, it is usually seen when abortions are done with metal instruments and done very vigorously. This results in adhesions in the inner uterine lining which result in less blood flow during the period. This could be either due to stress or mental anxiety. Try a hysteroscopy to diagnose Asherman's syndrome. It will not be diagnosed with an ultrasound.

Thanks, YYYY@YYYY","There are several possible causes of muscle soreness in the thighs. Some common causes include:Overuse: If you have recently increased the intensity or duration of your physical activity, it is possible that you are experiencing muscle soreness as a result of overuse.

It usually occurs a day or two after the activity and can last for a few days.Inactivity: If you have been inactive for an extended period of time and then suddenly engage in physical activity, you may also experience muscle soreness. This is because your muscles are not used to the activity and need time to adjust.Poor posture: Poor posture can put additional strain on your muscles, leading to soreness. For example, if you sit in a chair all day with poor posture, your leg muscles may become sore.Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause muscle soreness.

If your wife has been sweating heavily or not drinking enough fluids, this could be a potential cause.Fever: A fever can cause muscle aches, chills, and rapid breathing. If your wife has a fever, she may also feel tired, have a headache, or experience a loss of appetite.Stress or anxiety: Stress and anxiety can cause muscle tension, which can lead to muscle spasms and cramps.

I allso have some minor pain when I breath in my chest area! Did I bruise my sternum bone?! Did I bruise my ribs?! I m breathing fine and my heart is beating fine!,"If you have bruised your ribs, the best thing to do is to rest and allow your body time to heal. Avoid activities that may cause further injury or discomfort, such as heavy lifting or vigorous exercise. You can also try taking over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help reduce pain and swelling. Applying ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, may also help reduce swelling and discomfort. It's important to drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest to help your body heal.If you are experiencing difficulty breathing or your pain is severe, you should seek medical attention.

Notes she had a clean margins when the pancreas was removed and did not have a whipple.,"It is possible that your wife's high HbA1c (a measure of blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months) and high blood sugar levels could be due to the remaining portion of the pancreas not functioning properly. The pancreas plays a key role in regulating blood sugar levels by producing the hormone insulin, which helps the body use glucose (a type of sugar) for energy. If the pancreas is not functioning properly or has been removed, it can lead to high blood sugar levels.However, it is also possible that these high blood sugar levels could be due to a recurrence of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer can sometimes cause the production of substances called tumour markers, which can lead to high blood sugar levels. It is important for your wife to speak with her healthcare team about her high blood sugar levels and discuss any potential underlying causes and treatment options.

This is because it does not seem to work and, in any case, calcium is an important mineral for proper bodily functioning. Some stones are composed of uric acid in which case allopurinol, to lower uric acid levels, may be prescribed. All recurrence rate of all stones can be reduced by increasing daily fluid intake.

The pain can be severe and may come in waves.The best remedy for renal colic is to drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to help flush the stone out of your system. Pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can also help to relieve the pain.

You should also aim to eat a healthy, balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and avoid foods that are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.If you have a sedentary lifestyle, it is important to get regular physical activity to help prevent kidney stones.

The effectiveness of condoms at preventing pregnancy is about 82% with typical use, meaning that about 18 out of 100 people who use condoms as their only form of birth control will become pregnant over the course of one year.If the condom broke during sex and your partner ejaculated inside you, there is a chance that you could become pregnant. It is important to remember that sperm can live inside the female reproductive tract for up to five days, so pregnancy is still possible even if you had sex several days ago.If you are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, you can take a pregnancy test or speak with a healthcare provider to find out more. Pregnancy tests are most accurate when taken at least a week after a missed period. It is also a good idea to consider using emergency contraception, such as the ""morning-after pill,"" to help reduce the risk of pregnancy.It is important to use condoms consistently and correctly to help reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

I was diagnosed in childhood with a bicuspid aortic valve, so I am quite active, run 30 min 6x a week, and weight lifting 30 min 3x a week. For the past few days I have been experiencing a light tingling in my left leg. My work and commute does involve a lot of sitting, so I m wondering if this may be the cause?","It is possible that the tingling sensation in your left leg could be related to your bicuspid aortic valve or it could be caused by something else. It is important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the tingling and determine the appropriate treatment.A bicuspid aortic valve is a congenital heart condition in which the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body, has only two leaflets instead of three. This can cause the valve to become narrowed or leaky, leading to heart problems. However, tingling in the legs is not typically a symptom of a bicuspid aortic valve.It is possible that the tingling sensation in your leg could be caused by a condition such as peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by a variety of factors, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and nerve compression. Prolonged sitting can also contribute to the development of peripheral neuropathy, as it can cause decreased blood flow to the legs.It is important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the tingling and determine the appropriate treatment. They may recommend certain lifestyle changes, such as standing up and stretching periodically during periods of prolonged sitting, or they may recommend other treatments depending on the cause of the tingling.",1,medicine

The raised, hard tissue you are describing could be due to swelling or scar tissue that has formed as part of the healing process.If the area is still painful or swollen after two months, it is a good idea to have it checked out by a healthcare provider. They can examine the area and determine if there are any underlying injuries or conditions that may be causing the symptoms. They can also provide recommendations for treatment, such as ice or heat therapy, pain medication, or physical therapy, to help manage the pain and promote healing.In the meantime, you can try gently massaging the area to help reduce swelling and improve circulation.

Atherosclerosis is a common condition that occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries, making them narrow and less flexible. This can reduce blood flow and increase the risk of serious health problems, such as heart attack and stroke.The term ""without aneurysm"" means that the abdominal aorta has not developed a bulge or swelling, known as an aneurysm. An aneurysm can occur when the walls of an artery become weak and the vessel expands or bulges outward. If the aneurysm ruptures, it can cause life-threatening bleeding.It's important to work with your healthcare provider to manage abdominal aorta atherosclerosis and to discuss any recommended treatment options. This may include lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and quitting smoking, as well as medications to help lower cholesterol and blood pressure.

Benign tumors are not usually a threat to health and do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, are made up of cancer cells that can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body, a process known as metastasis.It is not possible for me to accurately determine whether or not your mother's tumor is cancerous without more information.

These symptoms can be caused by a variety of medical conditions, including liver disease, dehydration, and infections.Liver disease: Dark urine and yellowing of the whites of the eyes (known as jaundice) can be symptoms of liver disease. The liver is responsible for breaking down and removing waste products from the body, and when it is not functioning properly, these waste products can build up and cause these symptoms.Dehydration: Dehydration can cause dark urine and thick semen. When you are dehydrated, your body does not have enough fluids to produce clear urine and thin semen. Dehydration can also cause other symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, and dry mouth.Infections: Some infections, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or urinary tract infections (UTIs), can cause dark urine and thick semen. If you have any concerns about the possibility of an STI or UTI, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider.It is always important to speak with a healthcare provider if you are experiencing any unusual symptoms.

While it's possible that the lump on your finger could be a harmless cyst that will go away on its own, it's also important to rule out other potential causes, such as a ganglion cyst, a bone spur, or a tumor.If the lump is small and not causing any problems, you may want to wait a few weeks to see if it goes away on its own.

I'll be happy to help with your questions.Regarding your question about lumbar lordosis, this refers to the normal curvature of the lower part of the spine. In a healthy spine, the lumbar region should have a natural inward curve, which is known as lordosis. Straightening of the lumbar lordosis, also known as flattening or loss of lordosis, may be a cause for concern and could indicate an underlying issue such as muscle weakness, a spinal condition, or poor posture. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional about this finding in your MRI report and to determine the appropriate course of action.As for your question about acne, there are many over-the-counter and prescription creams and ointments that may be effective for treating acne. Some options include benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and retinoids. It's important to choose a product that is appropriate for your skin type and to follow the instructions for use carefully. If you have tried several different products without success, it may be helpful to speak with a dermatologist or other healthcare professional for additional guidance and treatment options.It's also worth noting that acne can be affected by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, certain medications, and certain skin care products. If you are suffering from PCOD (polycystic ovary syndrome), this could also contribute to acne breakouts. It's important to work with a healthcare professional to address any underlying factors and to find a treatment plan that works for you.",1,medicine

These medications can help to reduce swelling and alleviate pain. It is important to follow the dosing instructions on the bottle and not take more medication than recommended.Applying ice to the affected area can also help to reduce swelling. Place an ice pack on the outside of the jaw for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day.If the pain or swelling is severe or does not improve after a few days, it is important to contact your son's dentist or oral surgeon. They may prescribe a stronger pain medication or recommend other treatment options.It is also important for your son to follow the post-operative instructions provided by the dentist or oral surgeon, such as keeping the mouth clean, avoiding strenuous activity, and not drinking through a straw.

My question is can i use the emergency contraceptive gain while i did not get period? i am very afraid i will fall pregnant,"There is no need to use an emergency contraceptive pill around the menstrual period because this is the safe period. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period. So, in the manner you have described, you cannot get pregnant and hence, there is no need to worry. Also, restrict the use of emergency contraceptive pills to once or twice a year since they have a high hormone content and hence disturb the hormone milieu of the body badly.

My question is can i use the emergency contraceptive gain while i did not get period? i am very afraid i will fall pregnant,"Emergency contraception, sometimes called the ""morning-after pill,"" is a type of birth control that can be taken after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure to prevent pregnancy. It is not intended to be used as a regular method of birth control and should not be taken more than once in a menstrual cycle. If you have had unprotected sex on multiple occasions and are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can help you determine the best course of action for your situation.It's worth noting that there are other, more reliable methods of birth control that can be used to prevent pregnancy. These include:Oral contraceptives (the ""pill""): These are pills that contain hormones that prevent pregnancy. They are taken daily and are available in different forms, including combination pills (which contain both estrogen and progestin) and progestin-only pills. Oral contraceptives are effective at preventing pregnancy when taken correctly, but they are not foolproof and can fail if you miss a dose or vomit after taking them.Intrauterine devices (IUDs): These are small, T-shaped devices that are inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. There are two types of IUDs: copper and hormonal. Copper IUDs work by releasing small amounts of copper into the uterus to kill or damage sperm, while hormonal IUDs release a low dose of progestin to thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus. IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy and can be left in place for several years.Barrier methods: These are physical barriers that prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Examples include male condoms, female condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps. Barrier methods are effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly, but they do not provide as much protection as other methods.It's important to choose a birth control method that is right for you and to use it consistently and correctly to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. If you have any questions or concerns about your options, it is a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider or a reproductive health professional. They can provide you with information and guidance on the different methods of birth control and help you choose the one that is best suited to your needs.",1,medicine

Dull ache is accompanies by ocean wave that ends with a stab. Then it repeats itself or does not. Thank you.,"It is possible for a person with a supraclinoid aneurysm to experience symptoms similar to those of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). However, it is important to note that aneurysms and TN are two separate conditions and it is important to accurately diagnose the cause of the symptoms in order to determine the appropriate course of treatment.Trigeminal neuralgia is a type of facial pain that is caused by irritation or damage to the trigeminal nerve, which is the nerve responsible for sensation in the face. It typically causes brief, severe attacks of facial pain that are triggered by certain stimuli, such as speaking, eating, or touching the face. The pain is often described as a sharp, stabbing sensation that can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities.On the other hand, an aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel that can occur anywhere in the body. Supraclinoid aneurysms are a type of aneurysm that occur in the blood vessels located above the clinoid process, which is a bony structure in the brain. These aneurysms can cause symptoms such as headache, neck pain, and visual changes, and can be life-threatening if they rupture.If you are experiencing symptoms that you believe may be related to a supraclinoid aneurysm or TN, it is important to speak with a neurosurgeon or other medical professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.

It is not known to affect the results of a D-dimer test.A D-dimer test is used to help diagnose a pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a blood clot. The D-dimer test measures the levels of a protein fragment (D-dimer) that is produced when a blood clot breaks down. Elevated levels of D-dimer can be a sign of a blood clot, but a negative D-dimer test does not necessarily rule out the possibility of a PE.There are other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to those of a PE, such as heart failure, pneumonia, and asthma.

Using a humidifier in your home can help keep the air moist, which can help reduce irritation and soreness.Try throat lozenges or hard candy: Sucking on throat lozenges or hard candy can help stimulate saliva production and coat your throat, which can help soothe irritation and reduce coughing.Avoid irritants: If you smoke or are around secondhand smoke, try to avoid it as much as possible. Smoking can irritate your throat and increase coughing. Similarly, try to avoid exposure to other irritants such as strong perfumes or air pollution.Get plenty of rest: Coughing can be exhausting, so it's important to get plenty of rest to allow your body to heal.If your soreness persists or is severe, or if you have other symptoms such as fever or difficulty swallowing, you should contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.",1,medicine

Ingesting toilet cleaner can be very dangerous and can cause serious health problems, including burns to the mouth and throat, stomach pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and even death in severe cases.If the person has ingested a significant amount of the toilet cleaner, they may need to undergo a procedure called ""gastric lavage,"" also known as a stomach wash, to remove the substance from their stomach. This involves inserting a tube through the person's mouth or nose and into their stomach, and then using a special solution to wash out the stomach.Other treatments may be necessary as well, depending on the specific symptoms and how much of the toilet cleaner was ingested. These may include medications to reduce nausea and vomiting, supportive care to help the person breathe and maintain their vital signs, and possibly even surgery to repair any damage caused by the toilet cleaner.It is important to follow the recommendations of the healthcare professionals caring for the person and to seek medical attention immediately if someone has ingested a potentially toxic substance.",1,medicine

The fact that her symptoms are modulated by the body movement is another argument in favor of these disorders, including possible musculo-skeletal pain. If her symptoms persist, I recommend consulting with the GP for a careful physical examination, a chest x ray, an abdominal ultrasound and some lab tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes) to rule out any other disorders related to this symptomatology.

IVF involves retrieving eggs from a woman's ovaries, fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory dish, and transferring the resulting embryos back into the woman's uterus. ICSI is a specific type of IVF that involves injecting a single sperm directly into an egg to fertilize it.The cost of IVF and ICSI can vary depending on the specific treatment plan, the location, and the individual medical needs of the patient. It is important to discuss the cost of these treatments with a fertility specialist or a fertility clinic to get a better understanding of the expenses involved.As for the effect of immature sperm on the outcome of IVF or ICSI, it is possible that using immature sperm for these procedures may increase the risk of certain genetic disorders or congenital malformations in the resulting offspring. However, it is important to note that the risk of genetic disorders or congenital malformations can also occur with normal, mature sperm. It is also worth noting that the success rates of IVF and ICSI are not significantly affected by the maturity of the sperm used.It is not uncommon for men with obstructive azoospermia (a condition in which the sperm ducts are blocked, preventing sperm from being ejaculated) to have sperm retrieved for use in assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF or ICSI. The specific treatment plan and length of time required for these procedures will depend on the individual circumstances of the patient.

Some possible causes of weakness and back pain after delivery include:Hormonal changes: During pregnancy, the body produces higher levels of the hormone relaxin, which helps to relax the muscles and ligaments in the pelvis. After delivery, these hormone levels return to normal, which can lead to muscle weakness and back pain.Physical strain: Giving birth can be physically demanding, and the strain on the muscles and ligaments during delivery can lead to weakness and back pain.Posture changes: The weight of the baby during pregnancy can cause the spine to curve, which can lead to back pain after delivery.Dehydration: Dehydration can cause muscle weakness and fatigue, which can contribute to back pain.There are several things that your wife can do to help manage the weakness and back pain after delivery:Get plenty of rest: It is important for your wife to get as much rest as possible during the postpartum period to allow her body to heal and recover.Drink plenty of fluids: Dehydration can contribute to muscle weakness and fatigue, so it is important for your wife to drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.Take a warm bath or use a heating pad: A warm bath or a heating pad can help to relax the muscles and reduce back pain.Use over-the-counter pain medication: Over-the-counter pain medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) can help to reduce pain and inflammation.It is also important for your wife to see a doctor if the pain is severe or if it is not improving with home treatment.

One possible cause is the presence of blood within the vein, which can cause the vein to become more rigid and harder to the touch. This is a normal physiological response that occurs during an erection, as the blood flow to the penis increases and the veins constrict to help maintain the erection.Another possible cause of a hard vein in the penis could be a condition called Peyronie's disease, which is characterized by the formation of scar tissue within the penis. This scar tissue can cause the penis to bend or curve abnormally and can also cause the veins to become more prominent and harder.It's important to note that the presence of a hard vein in the penis alone is not necessarily a cause for concern, and it can be a normal variant in some individuals. However, if you are experiencing ED, lacking morning erections, and weak erections, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and discuss treatment options.

It typically lasts only a few minutes and is not generally a cause for concern.There are several theories about what causes brain freeze, but the most likely explanation is that the rapid ingestion of cold substances causes a sudden constriction of blood vessels in the head and neck, leading to a reduction in blood flow to the brain. This temporary decrease in blood flow can cause a sensation of pain or discomfort.It is possible that your recent change in medications could be contributing to your brain freeze, although it is not the most likely cause.

Thanks,"There are several possible causes for watery sperm, or semen that appears thin or diluted. These can include:Hydration levels: Dehydration can cause semen to be thinner and more watery.Ejaculation frequency: Men who ejaculate less frequently may have more watery sperm, as the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, which contribute to the production of semen, have more time to secrete fluids.Hormonal imbalances: Certain hormones, such as testosterone, play a role in the production of semen. A deficiency in these hormones can lead to thin, watery sperm.Infections or inflammation: Some infections or inflammation of the reproductive system, such as prostatitis or epididymitis, can cause changes in the consistency of semen.Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as retrograde ejaculation or varicoceles, can also cause watery sperm.It's important to note that the appearance of semen can vary from person to person and can also change over time.

Now i want to know if i can concieve during taking this medicine , is there any harm being pregnant?","Hallow Dear,Tuberculosis affects the fertility by:1. Reducing general health. Mother nature has arranged our body functioning in such a way that whenever there is any risk to life, the reproductory function is jeopardized first. However, Tuberculosis is such commonly wide spread disease in India and still the population is increasing. By and large, Pulmonary tuberculosis in early stage does not affect fertility. 2. By affecting the Reproductory Organs: When there is Genital tuberculosis, the tubes and uterine lining (endometrium) get affected. Affected endometrium is not conducive for implantation of the fertilized ovum and hence pregnancy is not possible. When the tubes get affected, there is tubal block. Along with the tubal block, tubal musculature also gets affected causing dysfunction in the tubal motility. Therefore, even after the surgical correction of the tubal block, if the tubal peristaltic movements are affected, conception is not possible. This is called as Functional Tubal Block; i.e. physically patent still functionally blocked tubes. You are suffering from Tubercular ascites. There is a good chance that due to ascetic fluid and peritoneal tubercular infection, the tubes and uterus also may be affected. Ultrasonography also will be of use for the purpose. Once you are cured, get investigated for fertility potential. Even if you are unable to conceive, you can adopt a child - this will give you a desired child, the child will get parents and still the population will not be increased.

Make sure you are also flossing daily to remove plaque and food particles from between your teeth. If you're not practicing good oral hygiene, this could be the cause of your bad breath.Diet: What you eat and drink can also contribute to bad breath.

Keep your hands away from the wound as much as possible to minimize the risk of introducing new bacteria or other contaminants.Seek medical attention if the wound becomes red, swollen, or starts to drain pus.

Avoid scrubbing or picking at the pimple.Apply a spot treatment: Look for a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These ingredients can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria. Follow the instructions on the product label carefully.Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer: Choose a moisturizer that is labeled ""non-comedogenic,"" which means it won't clog pores. Moisturizing the skin can help keep it healthy and prevent new pimples from forming.Avoid certain triggers: Some things can make pimples more likely to form, such as squeezing or picking at the skin, using oil-based skin care products, and not removing makeup before bed. Encourage your daughter to avoid these triggers.It's also a good idea to have your daughter see a dermatologist or healthcare provider if the pimple persists or if you are concerned about her skin in any way. The dermatologist can evaluate the pimple and recommend appropriate treatment.",1,medicine

In many cases, the cause of hematospermia is unknown and resolves on its own without any treatment. However, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause and rule out any underlying serious conditions.There are several possible causes of hematospermia, including:Infection: A bacterial infection of the prostate, bladder, or urinary tract can cause hematospermia.Inflammation: Inflammation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, or other reproductive organs can cause hematospermia.Trauma: Injuries to the prostate, bladder, or other reproductive organs can cause hematospermia.Abnormal blood vessels: Abnormal blood vessels in the prostate or other reproductive organs can cause hematospermia.Cancer: Rarely, hematospermia can be a sign of cancer of the prostate or other reproductive organs.It is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause of hematospermia and receive appropriate treatment. Your healthcare provider may recommend further testing, such as a physical exam, blood tests, urine tests, or imaging tests (such as ultrasound or CT scan).In most cases, treatment for hematospermia depends on the underlying cause. If an infection is the cause, treatment may involve antibiotics. If inflammation is the cause, treatment may involve anti-inflammatory medications or other medications to manage symptoms. If cancer is the cause, treatment may involve surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.It is important to practice safe sex and to maintain good hygiene to reduce the risk of infections and other conditions that can cause hematospermia. If you are experiencing any other symptoms or concerns, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.",1,medicine

57567,24566,Is sore palate can be a result of post nasal drip?Can a sore palate be a result of post nasal drip. pseudophed helps.,"Yes, a sore palate (the roof of the mouth) can be a result of post nasal drip. Post nasal drip is a condition in which mucus from the sinuses drains down the back of the throat, often causing irritation and inflammation. This can lead to a sore palate, as well as other symptoms such as a sore throat, cough, and congestion.Pseudoephedrine is a medication that can help to alleviate symptoms of post nasal drip by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages and reducing inflammation. It is often used in combination with other medications to relieve symptoms of sinusitis, allergies, and the common cold. However, it is important to note that pseudoephedrine can have side effects and may not be suitable for everyone.

It is possible that some sperm may have been present in pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) and could potentially cause pregnancy, although the chances are generally considered to be low. Additionally, the fact that you were already sick could potentially affect your fertility.It is important to note that condoms are the most effective method of contraception for preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections when used consistently and correctly.

He will be calling his doctor to be safe.thank youangie,"There are several possible causes for difficulty in urination after sexual activity. One possible cause is a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are caused by bacteria entering the urinary system, and they can cause symptoms such as a frequent or urgent need to urinate, pain or burning during urination, and a weak urine stream. UTIs are more common in women than men, but men can also get them, especially if they have had unprotected sex. Other possible causes of difficulty in urination after sex include prostate problems, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and inflammation of the urinary system.It is important for your boyfriend to see a doctor to determine the cause of his symptoms and get appropriate treatment. The doctor will likely recommend a urine test to check for the presence of bacteria or other abnormal substances, and may also recommend other tests or treatments depending on the cause of the symptoms.In the meantime, your boyfriend can try drinking plenty of fluids and urinating frequently to help flush any bacteria or other substances out of his urinary system.

Here are some potential treatment options that your healthcare provider may consider:Offloading: It is important to take the pressure off the ulcerated area to allow for proper healing. This can be achieved by using special shoes or inserts that redistribute weight away from the affected toes.Debridement: Dead or damaged tissue around the ulcer may need to be removed (debrided) to allow for proper healing. This can be done through surgical or non-surgical means.Wound dressings: A variety of wound dressings may be used to protect the ulcer and keep it moist, which can facilitate healing. These may include hydrocolloid dressings, foam dressings, or alginate dressings.Infection management: If the ulcer is infected, antibiotics may be prescribed to clear the infection.Blood sugar control: Good blood sugar control is essential for proper wound healing. Your healthcare provider may adjust your diabetes medications or insulin regimen to help achieve better blood sugar control.Vascular assessment: The decreased blood flow to your toes (as indicated by the abnormal ankle-brachial index) may be contributing to the slow healing of the ulcers. Your healthcare provider may refer you to a vascular specialist for further assessment and possible treatment.It is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare provider and to keep all follow-up appointments.

He has severe motor tics. Is there any reasearch to link this to flu vaccine? I have just realized that his symptoms were preceeded by a flu shot last year. His symptoms worsened this year after getting a flu shot.,"There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the flu vaccine causes motor tics or PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections). The flu vaccine is a safe and effective way to protect against influenza, a potentially serious respiratory illness that can lead to hospitalization and even death.PANDAS is a rare condition that is thought to be caused by an autoimmune response to a streptococcal infection, such as strep throat. The exact cause of PANDAS is not fully understood, and it is not caused by vaccines. Motor tics are involuntary, repetitive movements or sounds that can be a symptom of a number of different conditions, including Tourette syndrome, which is a neurological disorder that can cause tics and other behavioral problems.It is important to note that temporal associations, such as the occurrence of symptoms after receiving a vaccine, do not necessarily imply a causal relationship. It is possible that the flu vaccine and your son's symptoms occurred at the same time by coincidence.If you have concerns about your son's health, it is important to speak with his healthcare provider.

I have been experiencing cramps in my lower abdomen and back pain for the last 3 days. The cramps are mild but remain throughout the day and get worsened after doing some strenuous work. Please advise.","Abdominal cramps during the menstrual cycle, also known as dysmenorrhea, are a common experience for many women. There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common type and is caused by contractions of the uterus during menstruation. These contractions can cause pain and cramping in the lower abdomen and back. Secondary dysmenorrhea is caused by an underlying medical condition, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids.If you are experiencing mild to moderate abdominal cramps during your menstrual cycle, it is likely due to primary dysmenorrhea. These cramps can be managed with over-the-counter pain medication, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, or by using heat therapy on the lower abdomen. Exercise, such as walking or stretching, may also help to alleviate cramping.If your cramps are severe or if you experience other symptoms, such as heavy bleeding or irregular periods, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider.

Sun exposure can worsen hyperpigmentation and scarring.Consider seeing a dermatologist or other skin care professional for treatment options such as laser therapy, microdermabrasion, or other medical procedures.

Do i still have ptb and is it again contagious after 6 months of treatment","Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a bacterial infection that affects the lungs. It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PTB can be latent (inactive) or active. Latent PTB means that you have the bacteria in your body, but it is not causing any symptoms and is not contagious. Active PTB means that the bacteria are actively growing and multiplying in your body, and you may experience symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. If you have had a positive sputum test and were diagnosed with PTB, it is likely that you received treatment to kill the bacteria and prevent the disease from becoming active.If your chest X-ray shows minimal PTB, it may mean that the bacteria are still present in your body but are not causing active disease. This could be because you are still receiving treatment or because the infection is latent. In either case, it is important to continue taking your medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider to ensure that the bacteria are completely eliminated from your body.It is also important to note that even if you are no longer experiencing symptoms and your sputum test is negative, you may still be able to transmit the bacteria to others if you are not taking your medication as prescribed. Therefore, it is important to continue taking your medication as directed by your healthcare provider to ensure that you remain non-contagious. If you have any concerns about your treatment or your risk of transmitting the disease to others, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider.",1,medicine

Have never had this before. What could it be?","There are a few possible reasons why you might experience pressure or pain while laughing. Here are a few possibilities:Muscle strain: Laughing can involve a lot of muscle movement, particularly in the abdominal and chest muscles. If you have strained these muscles, you may experience pain or discomfort while laughing.Chest infection: If you have a chest infection, such as pneumonia or bronchitis, you may experience pain while laughing due to the increased pressure on your chest and lungs.Acid reflux: If you have acid reflux, laughing may exacerbate your symptoms by increasing pressure on your stomach and causing acid to travel up your esophagus.Heart problems: In rare cases, chest pain while laughing could be a sign of a more serious problem, such as a heart attack or angina. If you are experiencing chest pain that is severe or persistent, or if you have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible.It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing unusual or persistent pain or discomfort, to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.",1,medicine

Any suggestions ?I have been suffering from indigestion , pllz givem the solution for that.","Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, is a common digestive disorder that can cause discomfort or pain in the stomach. It is often accompanied by symptoms such as bloating, heartburn, and nausea.There are a number of things you can try to relieve indigestion:Avoid trigger foods: Certain foods and drinks, such as fatty or spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol, can contribute to indigestion. Try to avoid or limit these foods to see if your symptoms improve.Eat smaller, more frequent meals: Overeating or eating too quickly can cause indigestion. Try eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day to allow your stomach time to digest.Avoid lying down after eating: Try to wait at least three hours after eating before lying down or going to bed. This can help prevent the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus.Stay upright after eating: Sitting up or standing can help keep stomach acid in the stomach, where it belongs.Try over-the-counter remedies: Antacids, such as Tums or Rolaids, can help neutralize stomach acid and provide temporary relief. H-2 receptor blockers, such as Zantac or Pepcid, can also help reduce acid production in the stomach.If your indigestion persists or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or black stools, it is important to see a doctor for further evaluation.",1,medicine

Please suggest me a solution for toothache problem.","There are several possible causes of severe toothache at night:Cavities: Toothaches are often caused by cavities, which are small holes in the teeth that can be caused by a buildup of plaque and bacteria. Cavities can be especially painful at night because there is less saliva in the mouth, which can help to neutralize the acid produced by bacteria.Infection: Toothaches can also be caused by an infection in the tooth or the surrounding gum tissue. Infections can be caused by bacteria that enter the tooth through a cavity or a crack in the tooth.Gum disease: Gum disease, or periodontal disease, can cause toothaches. This is an infection of the gums that can cause inflammation and pain in the teeth and gums.Tooth grinding: Tooth grinding, also known as bruxism, can cause toothaches. This occurs when a person grinds their teeth together, often while they are sleeping.Tooth trauma: Tooth trauma, such as a chipped or broken tooth, can cause toothaches.To find relief from a toothache, you should see a dentist as soon as possible. They will be able to diagnose the cause of the toothache and recommend appropriate treatment, which may include filling a cavity, treating an infection, or repairing a broken tooth.

Scabies is a skin condition caused by an infestation of the human itch mite, which burrows into the skin and lays eggs. The symptoms of scabies include intense itching, particularly at night, and a rash that appears as small, raised red bumps or blisters. The rash is often found in areas where the mites like to burrow, such as the folds of the skin, between the fingers and toes, and on the wrists, elbows, and buttocks.If you have been diagnosed with scabies and have been prescribed an antibiotic cream, it is important to follow the instructions for use and continue using the cream until the infestation has been fully treated.

They can provide important information about how well the liver is functioning, but they cannot provide a definitive diagnosis on their own. Other factors, such as the results of imaging tests, the presence of symptoms, and the patient's medical history, also need to be taken into consideration.With that said, it's difficult to interpret the results of liver function tests without knowing the reference ranges for the specific laboratory that performed the tests. These ranges can vary slightly from lab to lab.

Elevated levels of ALP in the blood can indicate liver or bone disease.Alanine transaminase (ALT): This enzyme is found primarily in the liver. Elevated levels of ALT in the blood can indicate liver damage or disease.Aspartate transaminase (AST): This enzyme is found in the liver, heart, muscle, and other organs. Elevated levels of AST in the blood can indicate liver damage or disease.Total bilirubin: This is a substance produced when red blood cells break down. Elevated levels of total bilirubin in the blood can indicate liver or blood disorders.Direct bilirubin: This is a subtype of bilirubin that is produced when red blood cells break down. Elevated levels of direct bilirubin in the blood can indicate liver disease.Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT): This enzyme is found in the liver, pancreas, and bile ducts. Elevated levels of GGT in the blood can indicate liver or bile duct disease.Albumin: This is a protein produced by the liver. Low levels of albumin in the blood can indicate liver disease or malnutrition.It's important to discuss these results with your child's healthcare provider, as they will be able to provide more specific information about what these results may mean in the context of your child's overall health and medical history.",1,medicine

Please suggest.It is difficult to accurately diagnose a skin condition without seeing it in person or obtaining more information about the symptoms you are experiencing. However, based on the description you provided, it is possible that you may be experiencing a condition called herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is a viral infection that can cause small, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, often in clusters. These blisters may be painful and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.If you are experiencing these symptoms, it is important to see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, you can try to relieve your symptoms by taking over-the-counter pain medication and keeping the affected area clean and dry. Avoid touching or scratching the blisters to prevent them from spreading.It is also possible that the symptoms you are experiencing could be caused by another skin condition, such as impetigo or folliculitis. Again, it is important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.",1,medicine

It is important to discuss all of the available options with your doctor and consider your individual circumstances and preferences when making a decision about the best course of action.Medical treatments for an endometrial thickness of 16mm may include hormone therapy, such as oral contraceptives or progestin-only therapy, to help thin the endometrial lining and regulate menstrual cycles.Surgical treatments for an endometrial thickness of 16mm may include a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C), in which the cervix is dilated and the endometrial lining is removed using a curette, or a hysterectomy, in which the uterus is removed.It is possible that the endometrial lining may thicken again after treatment, and your doctor will recommend ongoing monitoring and follow-up to ensure that the thickness remains at a healthy level. If the endometrial lining does begin to thicken again, additional treatment may be necessary.As with any medical procedure, there is a risk of infection with a surgical treatment for an endometrial thickness of 16mm. Your doctor will take steps to minimize this risk, such as using sterile techniques and prescribing antibiotics as needed.It is important to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits of any treatment option before making a decision.

They can appear anywhere on the body, but are commonly found on the face, particularly the chin and around the lips.There are several steps you can take to help clear or lessen the appearance of whiteheads:Keep your skin clean: Wash your face twice a day with a mild, oil-free cleanser to remove excess oil and dirt. Avoid scrubbing your skin, as this can irritate it and make the problem worse.Use salicylic acid: This is a type of beta hydroxy acid that helps to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores. Look for products that contain salicylic acid, such as face washes or toners, and use them as directed.Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer: Choose a moisturizer that is specifically designed for acne-prone skin and won't clog pores. Look for products that are labeled ""non-comedogenic"" or ""oil-free. ""Avoid touching your face: Hands can transfer bacteria and oil to the skin, so it's important to avoid touching your face as much as possible.Avoid picking or squeezing whiteheads: This can cause inflammation and may lead to scarring. If you do need to extract a whitehead, make sure to do it gently and with clean hands and tools.Use a gentle exfoliant: Gently exfoliating your skin can help to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Look for products that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs).Use a spot treatment: If you have a single whitehead that you need to treat, you can use a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These products can help to kill bacteria and dry out the whitehead.It's important to remember that it can take time and patience to clear up whiteheads. If you have tried these steps and your whiteheads are still not improving, it may be a good idea to see a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.",1,medicine

Sexual activity irritates it and therefore is becoming difficult. I am taking oral antibiotics and topical treatment but nothing is working. How can I treat this?","Folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles that can occur anywhere on the body, including the penis. It can be caused by a variety of factors, such as bacteria, fungi, or irritation from clothing or other substances.Treatment for folliculitis on the penis will depend on the underlying cause and the severity of the infection. Here are some potential treatment options:Antibiotics: If the infection is caused by bacteria, your doctor may prescribe oral or topical antibiotics to help kill the bacteria and prevent the infection from spreading.Antifungal medications: If the infection is caused by a fungus, your doctor may prescribe antifungal medications to help kill the fungus and clear up the infection.Soothing creams and ointments: Your doctor may recommend using creams or ointments to soothe the skin and help reduce irritation and inflammation.Avoiding irritants: If certain substances or activities are causing irritation or worsening the infection, it may be necessary to avoid them until the infection has cleared up.It's important to follow your doctor's treatment recommendations closely and complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed, even if the symptoms improve. If your symptoms do not improve after a week or two of treatment, or if the infection appears to be getting worse, it's important to follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and possible changes to your treatment plan.",1,medicine

If the rash is severe or accompanied by other symptoms, such as fever, difficulty breathing, or extreme discomfort, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible.In the meantime, you can try to keep the affected area clean and dry, and apply a moisturizing cream or lotion to help soothe the skin. If the rash is itchy, you can give your son over-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl, to help reduce the itching. You should also try to avoid scratching the rash, as this can lead to further irritation and potentially even infection.It's also a good idea to monitor the rash for any changes in appearance or severity. If the rash does not improve or begins to spread or worsen, you should contact a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.",1,medicine

The Depot injection is a long-acting form of birth control that contains the hormone progestin. It is administered by injection every three months and is intended to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). If you have missed a shot, it is possible that you may not be fully protected from pregnancy.There are several types of pregnancy tests available, including home tests that can be purchased at a pharmacy or online. These tests work by detecting the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that is produced by the placenta after fertilization and is present in the urine of pregnant women. Pregnancy tests are generally accurate when used correctly, but it is important to follow the instructions carefully and to read the results within the recommended time frame.If you think you may be pregnant or are experiencing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, or missed periods, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider as soon as possible.

Pregnancy can be a challenging time for women with diabetes, as the increased hormone levels and changes in metabolism can make it harder to control blood sugar levels. However, with proper planning and medical supervision, women with diabetes can have a successful pregnancy.Here are some steps you can take to ensure a healthy pregnancy:Keep your blood sugar levels in good control: It is important to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range before and during pregnancy to reduce the risk of complications. This may involve adjusting your diet, increasing physical activity, and taking medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider.Get early and regular prenatal care: Make sure to see your healthcare provider as soon as you find out you are pregnant. Regular prenatal care will help your healthcare team monitor your health and the health of your baby.Take care of your overall health: In addition to managing your blood sugar levels, it is important to take care of your overall health during pregnancy. This includes getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and staying active.Be prepared for emergencies: It is important to be prepared for any potential emergencies that may arise during pregnancy. Make sure you know how to recognize the signs of high or low blood sugar, and have a plan in place for how to manage these situations.Overall, it is important to work closely with your healthcare team and follow their recommendations to ensure a healthy pregnancy.",1,medicine

This could be due to an infection or to many other causes. The inflammatory process and the change in ESR could be due to the infection and would occur regardless of antibiotic treatment- it is part of the body's response to the infection. If the infection clears up with treatment, the inflammatory process will start to clear up, but signs of it such as the ESR may take some time to return to normal. The ESR is not useful for following the course of an infection. Again, it may also be due to an entirely different condition from the infection, such as arthritis, lupus, response to injuries, etc etc. Hope this helps.",0,medicine

My  esr  increased from  35 t0 55 even when i had taken 250 mg proximexa  as advised by my doctor since he suspected infection. why did my esr increase after 3 days of antibiotics?","Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that measures the rate at which red blood cells (erythrocytes) sediment in a tube over a period of time. It is not a specific test for any particular disease, but it can be elevated in a variety of conditions, including infections, inflammation, and certain types of cancer. It is not uncommon for ESR to increase slightly in response to an infection, as the body's immune system responds to the infection by releasing substances that can cause inflammation.There are several reasons why ESR may increase after starting antibiotics:The infection is causing inflammation: As mentioned above, ESR can be elevated in response to inflammation, and infections can often cause inflammation. If the infection is causing inflammation, then ESR may increase as the body's immune system responds to the infection.The antibiotics are causing inflammation: Some antibiotics can cause inflammation as a side effect. This is not a common side effect, but it is possible. If the antibiotics you are taking are causing inflammation, then ESR may increase as a result.The infection is not responding to the antibiotics: If the infection is not responding to the antibiotics, then ESR may continue to increase despite treatment. This could be due to a number of factors, such as antibiotic resistance or an underlying condition that is making it difficult for the antibiotics to work effectively.It is important to note that ESR is not a specific test for infection, and the presence of an infection does not necessarily mean that ESR will be elevated. Similarly, an increase in ESR does not necessarily mean that an infection is present. It is important to discuss any concerns or questions you have about your ESR with your healthcare provider. They can help interpret the results of your ESR test and determine the best course of treatment based on your individual situation.",1,medicine

It is important to seek medical attention if you are concerned about pimples on your penis, as some STIs can have serious consequences if left untreated.Here are some suggestions for how to get rid of pimples on the penis:Keep the area clean and dry: Wash the area gently with warm water and a mild soap. Avoid using scented products, as they can irritate the skin.Avoid tight clothing: Wear loose-fitting clothing to allow the skin to breathe and reduce irritation.Apply a warm compress: Place a warm, damp cloth on the affected area for a few minutes to help reduce swelling and discomfort.Use over-the-counter creams: Topical creams containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can help dry out the pimples and reduce redness.Seek medical attention: If the pimples do not go away or if you have other symptoms such as pain, discharge, or difficulty urinating, it is important to see a healthcare provider.

It could be a swollen lymph node, which is a small, round, bean-shaped structure that is part of the body's immune system. Lymph nodes can become swollen in response to infection, inflammation, or other types of injury.Another possibility is that the lump could be a cyst, which is a closed sac containing fluid, pus, or other material. Cysts can occur anywhere on the body and are usually benign (not cancerous). They can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, inflammation, or blockages in the glands or ducts.It is also possible that the lump could be a hematoma, which is a collection of blood that has escaped from a damaged blood vessel. Hematomas can occur as a result of trauma or injury, such as a blow to the area or a surgical procedure.It is important to have the lump checked by a healthcare provider to determine the cause and determine the appropriate treatment, if necessary.

When can I have my tests of HIV and STDs done?","It is important to be aware that engaging in unprotected anal sex carries a high risk of HIV transmission, as well as other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). HIV is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids, and the lining of the anus is more prone to tearing and exposure to HIV than the lining of the vagina or mouth. This means that the risk of HIV transmission during anal sex is higher than during other sexual activities.The chances of getting HIV after unprotected anal sex depend on several factors, including the HIV status of the partner, the presence of other STIs, and the presence of any cuts or abrasions on the skin. It is also important to consider the prevalence of HIV in the community where the sexual encounter took place, as HIV is more common in some populations than others.If you are concerned about the possibility of HIV transmission, it is important to get tested as soon as possible. HIV testing should be done at least 3-6 weeks after potential exposure, as it can take that long for the virus to be detectable in the body. You can also be tested for other STIs at this time. It is important to note that some STIs, including HIV, may not show up on a test until several weeks or even months after infection, so it is important to practice safe sex and get tested regularly to ensure that you are not unknowingly transmitting HIV or other STIs to your partners.",1,medicine

Is there any option they would do for me to be more comfortable?","It's understandable that you may be feeling anxious about getting a shot and having wisdom tooth removal surgery. However, there are steps that can be taken to help make you more comfortable during the procedure.First, it's important to choose a dental or oral surgeon that you feel comfortable with and trust. Having a good relationship with your surgeon can help put you at ease. You can also discuss your concerns with the surgeon beforehand and ask about the type of anesthesia that will be used and how it will be administered.There are several types of anesthesia that can be used for wisdom tooth removal, including local anesthesia, intravenous (IV) sedation, and general anesthesia. Local anesthesia numbs the area around the tooth and is often used in combination with other forms of anesthesia. IV sedation involves the administration of medications through a vein to help you relax and feel drowsy. General anesthesia is administered through an IV or by inhaling gases and results in a deep sleep, so you will not be aware of the procedure.Your surgeon will determine the best type of anesthesia for you based on factors such as the complexity of the procedure, your medical history, and your level of anxiety. You should discuss your preferences with the surgeon and ask any questions you have about the anesthesia.It's also a good idea to have a friend or family member present during the procedure to provide support and comfort. They can stay with you in the waiting room or the recovery area and be there when you wake up.Finally, try to relax and take deep breaths during the procedure. This can help calm your nerves and make the experience more comfortable.",1,medicine

Why would a patient with esophageal cancer have a feeding tube inserted surgically into the duodenum and not into the stomach?,"A feeding tube may be inserted surgically into the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) for a patient with esophageal cancer if the cancer or its treatment has caused significant damage to the esophagus that makes it difficult or impossible for the patient to swallow and get enough nutrition orally. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and is located just after the stomach, so a feeding tube placed in the duodenum allows nutrition to bypass the damaged esophagus and be delivered directly to the small intestine, where it can be absorbed and used by the body.Inserting a feeding tube into the duodenum is typically done through a procedure called a duodenostomy. This involves making a small incision in the abdomen and inserting the feeding tube through the incision and into the duodenum. Duodenostomy may be preferred over inserting the feeding tube into the stomach (gastrostomy) because the duodenum is closer to the liver and may be more efficient at absorbing nutrients. Additionally, the duodenum has a thinner wall than the stomach and may be less prone to irritation from the feeding tube.It is important to note that a feeding tube is not the only option for providing nutrition to a patient with esophageal cancer. Other options may include a liquid diet, medications to help with swallowing, or placing a stent in the esophagus to keep it open and allow for easier swallowing. The best approach will depend on the specific circumstances of the patient and will be determined by the healthcare team.",1,medicine

I have heard of some women taking soy isoflavones vitamins with metformin and it helping them get pregnant. Is this true and is it safe for me to try this? I have been trying to concieve for 5 years now.,"Hallow Dear, In Polycystic Ovarian syndrome, the main disorders are infertility due to failure to release eggs (ovulation) as a result of dysfunction in reproductory hormones, raised insulin levels and raised androgens. Metformin helps bring down the levels of Insulin. It acts as a good adjuvant to the medicines used for induction of ovulation. The success of only Metformin for the treatment of anovulatory infertility is questionable. According to some scientists, Myo inositol brings down the levels of Insulin as well as androgens and hence is more effective in the treatment of infertility due to PCOS. For induction of ovulation, Clomiphene citrate may be tried for 6 cycles (along with Metformin or Myo inositol). If it fails, HMG/hCG combination may be tried. PCOS is characterised by obesity. Soy isoflavones are supposed to improve general health as well as the quality of the eggs, increasing the possibility of successful pregnancy. I hope this will help you to seek for a comprehensive management of PCOS. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri",0,medicine

I have been trying to concieve for 5 years now.,"However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any new supplement, especially if you are trying to conceive or are taking other medications.Soy isoflavones are plant-based compounds that are similar to the hormone estrogen. They are found in soybeans and other legumes, and are sometimes taken in supplement form. Some studies have suggested that soy isoflavones may help regulate menstrual cycles and improve fertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common cause of fertility problems. However, the evidence is not strong and more research is needed to confirm these findings.Metformin is a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and PCOS. It works by decreasing the amount of sugar produced by the liver and increasing the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin, which helps lower blood sugar levels. They can help you weigh the potential risks and benefits and determine the best course of action for your specific situation.",1,medicine

Is that of concern?","It is normal for babies to develop pimples on their skin, especially on their face. These pimples, called neonatal acne, are caused by hormones that are passed from the mother to the baby before birth. They usually appear within the first few weeks of life and resolve on their own within a few months.To help prevent or treat neonatal acne, you can try the following measures:Keep your baby's skin clean by washing their face with water and a mild, fragrance-free baby soap or cleansing bar. Avoid using harsh or medicated cleansers.Pat the skin dry gently after washing. Avoid rubbing the skin or using hot water, as this can irritate the pimples and make them worse.Avoid applying lotions, creams, or oils to the affected area, as these can clog the pores and make the acne worse.If the acne persists or becomes more severe, you may want to consult a pediatrician for further evaluation and treatment. They may recommend a mild topical medication or other treatment options.As for the hair on your baby's body, it is not uncommon for newborns to have a lot of hair, especially on their face. This is called lanugo and is typically temporary, disappearing within a few weeks or months. There is no need to do anything about it, as it will fall out on its own.",1,medicine

However, if the liver inflammation is due to a chronic condition, such as alcohol abuse or autoimmune hepatitis, it may require ongoing treatment to prevent further damage to the liver.It is important to speak with a healthcare provider about your specific situation and the specific cause of your liver inflammation.

A blocked nose can be caused by a variety of things, including a cold or allergies, and it is important to determine the cause in order to determine the appropriate treatment. Saline water can be helpful in loosening and removing mucus, but if it is not effective, your doctor may recommend using a saline nasal spray or drops to help clear the blockage.It is also important to make sure that your baby is getting enough fluids, as a blocked nose can make it difficult for them to eat and drink. You can try using a bulb syringe to gently suction out any mucus that may be blocking their airways.If your baby is having difficulty breathing or is showing other signs of distress, such as a rapid or irregular heartbeat, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible.

Ive never suffered with it before. I have also given it to my boyfriend and his penis is red and sore. im using canestan cream however there doesnt seem to be progress could this be because im taking yasmin?,"Hi, Yes, the birth control pill 'yasmin' can cause thrush/yeast infection. Yasmin is a combined oral contraceptive pill that contains two different hormones viz. estrogen and progesterone. Taking these pills can cause hormonal balance which helps the yeast to grow. It is believed that the estrogen in birth control pills can cause the vagina to produce more sugars. These sugars feed the yeast already living in the vagina causing overgrowth and thus infection (vaginal thrush or candidiasis). It is a similar effect to that seen in pregnancy when estrogen levels rise naturally. If the infection bothers you too much you could be switched to a different kind of contraceptive pill with a stronger progesterone component and a weaker estrogen component or consider going on the mini-pill which only contains progesterone.

Recently I had acid reflux in the night and felt the rate was high. It wasn't until after exercise that I realized it was around 155 and apparently had been at that rate for about 7 hours,"Hello,Acid reflux or exercise can increase increase heart rate slightly, but 155 persisting for 7 hours is less likely. This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up. Blood pressure may fall during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holter monitoring or get ecg done during high heart rate. Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Is there any stress or anxiety associated. If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases.

Recently I had acid reflux in the night and felt the rate was high. It wasn't until after exercise that I realized it was around 155 and apparently had been at that rate for about 7 hours,"It is possible for acid reflux to cause an increase in heart rate. Acid reflux, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a condition in which stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach). This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing.In some cases, acid reflux can also lead to other symptoms, including a rapid heart rate. This may occur because the acid irritates the esophagus and can lead to inflammation, which can affect the functioning of the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve helps regulate the heart rate, and when it is irritated or inflamed, it can cause the heart to beat faster.It is important to note that a rapid heart rate can also be caused by other factors, such as stress, anxiety, physical activity, or certain medications. If you are experiencing a rapid heart rate, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment.",1,medicine

The best option for you will depend on the size and location of the stone, as well as your overall health and medical history. Some common treatment options include:Medications: Your doctor may prescribe medications to help you pass the kidney stone more easily. These may include medications to help relax the muscles in your ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder), or medications to help break down the stone.Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL): This is a non-invasive procedure that uses shock waves to break the kidney stone into smaller pieces, which can then pass more easily through the urinary tract.Ureteroscopy: This is a procedure in which a small, flexible tube with a light and camera on the end is inserted through the urethra and up into the urinary tract. The doctor can then use instruments to remove the kidney stone or break it up into smaller pieces.Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): This is a surgical procedure in which a small incision is made in the back, and a tube is inserted through the incision and into the kidney to remove the stone.Open surgery: In some cases, open surgery may be necessary to remove a large or complex kidney stone. This involves making a larger incision in the abdomen to access the stone and remove it.Your doctor will discuss the best treatment options for you based on the size and location of your kidney stone, as well as your overall health and medical history.

Bypass surgery is adviced when there are multiple widespread blockages involving the major arteries of the heart. Bypass surgery requires planning, patient preparation etc. Again it takes about 4 days to patient to be back on his legs and some 20 days to recover totally.

The procedure involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the arm or leg, and injecting a dye that can be seen on x-ray images.Warfarin is a medication that is used to prevent blood clots from forming.

The child is then trained to wake up and go to the bathroom when the alarm goes off.Medication: Desmopressin is a medication that can be used to reduce the amount of urine produced at night. It is typically taken before bedtime and can be effective in reducing bedwetting.Bladder training: This involves teaching the child to increase the amount of time between urination and gradually increase the amount of fluid they drink. This can help strengthen the bladder muscles and improve bladder control.Limiting fluids before bedtime: Limiting the amount of fluids the child consumes before bedtime can help reduce the likelihood of bedwetting.Diet changes: Some children may have food allergies or sensitivities that can contribute to bedwetting. It may be helpful to eliminate certain foods from the child's diet to see if this makes a difference.You can have food allergy tests carried out at a medical clinic or laboratory. The most common test is the skin prick test, which involves applying a small amount of a suspected allergen to the skin and observing the reaction. Blood tests can also be used to test for allergies.

This can be a normal finding in older individuals, or it can be caused by a variety of factors such as chronic illness, genetics, or a previous head injury.The scan also shows evidence of periventricular chronic ischemic changes, which means that there have been chronic (long-term) changes in the blood supply to the brain, specifically in the areas around the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces in the brain). This can also be a normal finding in older individuals, or it can be caused by various factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease.It is important to note that a CT scan is just one tool that can be used to evaluate the brain and that it is important to discuss the findings with a healthcare provider in order to fully understand the implications and potential next steps. It is also important to consider other factors such as your father's overall health and any symptoms he may be experiencing.",1,medicine

This process, known as fertilization, typically occurs within a day or two after ovulation, which is when an egg is released from the ovary.If you have not yet ovulated, it is possible that the Fertigyn injections you took may cause ovulation to occur. Ovulation typically occurs about 14 days after the start of the menstrual cycle, but this can vary from person to person. However, it is important to note that it is possible to become pregnant at any time during the menstrual cycle, as sperm can live inside the female reproductive tract for several days. If you are trying to become pregnant, it is generally recommended to have regular, unprotected intercourse throughout the menstrual cycle to increase your chances of conceiving.If you are concerned about your fertility or are having difficulty becoming pregnant, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider. They can help you understand your fertility and suggest appropriate treatment options if necessary.",1,medicine

I have severe degenerative spine disease with spinal stenosis in my lumbar and cervical spine. Any suggestions?,"Mid-back pain that radiates towards the ribs can have a variety of causes, and in your case, it is likely related to your degenerative spine disease and spinal stenosis.Spinal stenosis is a condition in which the spinal canal narrows, placing pressure on the nerves that travel through it. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area. In your case, the pain may be radiating to your ribs because the affected nerve roots or spinal cord are located in the mid-back region and are being compressed by the narrowing of the spinal canal.Some other potential causes of mid-back pain include muscle strain, herniated discs, and spinal fractures. It is important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They will be able to assess your specific situation and recommend the best course of action. This may include medications to manage the pain, physical therapy to strengthen the muscles supporting the spine, and possibly surgery to decompress the nerves or stabilize the spine.It is also important to practice good posture and engage in regular exercise to help maintain the health and strength of your spine. Avoiding activities that put excessive strain on your back, such as lifting heavy objects, can also help to prevent further pain and injury.",1,medicine

However, it is important to follow your healthcare provider's instructions and to discuss any concerns you have about your medication with them.It is also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including following a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, to help manage your blood pressure. This can often help to control blood pressure without the need for medication, or may allow you to take lower doses of medication. It is always a good idea to discuss any lifestyle changes you are considering with your healthcare provider.",1,medicine

It is usually caused by damage to the glomeruli, which are tiny filters in the kidneys that help remove waste and excess fluids from the blood.The treatment of nephrotic syndrome depends on the underlying cause of the condition. Some common treatments include:Medications: Your doctor may prescribe medications to help control high blood pressure, reduce swelling, and prevent complications such as infections.Diet: Your doctor may recommend a low-salt diet to help control blood pressure and reduce swelling.Blood pressure control: High blood pressure is a common complication of nephrotic syndrome, and it is important to keep it under control to prevent further damage to the kidneys.Immunosuppressive therapy: If the cause of nephrotic syndrome is an autoimmune disorder, your doctor may recommend immunosuppressive therapy to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the kidneys.Dialysis: If your kidneys are severely damaged, you may need dialysis to filter waste and excess fluids from your blood.It is important to follow your treatment plan and attend follow-up appointments with your doctor to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed.",1,medicine

It can cause muscle weakness and paralysis, and it can be life-threatening if it affects the muscles that control breathing.To confirm a diagnosis of GBS, a healthcare provider will typically perform a physical examination, review the patient's medical history, and order laboratory tests and imaging studies. The healthcare provider may also perform a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test, which measures the speed at which electrical impulses travel through a nerve. In GBS, NCV is often slowed.Other tests that may be used to confirm a diagnosis of GBS include:Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): This test involves removing a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lower back. An abnormal CSF protein level may suggest GBS.Electromyography (EMG): This test measures the electrical activity of muscles. It can help confirm nerve damage and determine the extent of muscle weakness.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI can help identify any abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord that may be causing the symptoms.It's important to note that the diagnosis of GBS can be challenging, as the symptoms can vary widely from person to person.

X ray after 5 weeks shows a dark oval shadow on the area of previous fracture. But the fracture has healed. I would like to know the reason for the dark shadow. What does it indicate?

The length of a menstrual cycle is typically 28 days, but it can range from 21 to 35 days. Ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day cycle, but this can vary based on the length of your cycle.Use ovulation predictor kits: These kits are available at pharmacies and can help you predict when you are ovulating by detecting the presence of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. LH surges just before ovulation and can be detected with an ovulation predictor kit.Track your basal body temperature: Your basal body temperature is your body's temperature at rest. It tends to rise slightly after ovulation. By taking your temperature every morning before you get out of bed and tracking it over time, you may be able to identify patterns and predict when you are most likely to ovulate.It is also important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your menstrual cycle and fertility. Your doctor may be able to suggest treatments or medications that can help regulate your menstrual cycle and increase your chances of getting pregnant. For example, the medication Fertyl (clomiphene) is often used to treat infertility in women with irregular periods.

What to do?","Nosebleeds can be scary, especially for young children, but they are usually not serious and can be managed at home. Here are some steps you can take to manage your daughter's nosebleeds:Have her sit upright and lean slightly forward. This will help reduce the amount of blood that flows down the back of the throat, which can cause nausea or vomiting.Have her pinch the soft part of her nose just below the bony bridge. This will help to close off the blood vessels and stop the bleeding. Have her hold this position for at least 5-10 minutes.If the bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes, you can try using a saline nasal spray or applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly inside the nostrils. This can help to moisturize the inside of the nostrils and reduce the likelihood of future nosebleeds.If the bleeding continues or if your daughter experiences repeated nosebleeds, you should contact your healthcare provider. It's also a good idea to contact your healthcare provider if your daughter has any other symptoms, such as fever, headache, or facial pain.In the meantime, try to keep the air in your home humid by using a humidifier or placing a bowl of water near a heat source. Dry air can contribute to nosebleeds.Avoid any activities that might irritate the inside of your daughter's nose, such as picking her nose or blowing her nose forcefully.I hope these suggestions help.

While it may be effective in reducing the number of pimples, it is important to use it as directed by your healthcare provider or according to the product's instructions.If you are using Erytop cream to treat pimples and are applying it at night and leaving it on overnight, it is important to wash it off in the morning. Leaving the cream on your skin for an extended period of time may increase the risk of side effects, such as skin irritation or dryness. It is also important to use a gentle cleanser to wash your face in the morning to avoid drying out your skin.In addition to using Erytop cream, there are several other things you can do to help improve the appearance of your skin and reduce the number of pimples:Keep your skin clean: Wash your face twice a day with a gentle, oil-free cleanser. Avoid scrubbing your skin, as this can irritate it and lead to more pimples.Avoid picking or squeezing pimples: This can lead to scarring and further irritation.Use a non-comedogenic moisturizer: Choose a moisturizer that is formulated for acne-prone skin and won't clog your pores.Use oil-free makeup and hair products: Look for products that are labeled ""non-comedogenic"" or ""oil-free,"" as these are less likely to cause pimples.Eat a healthy diet: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats may help improve the appearance of your skin.It is always a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider or dermatologist if you have concerns about your skin or the treatment you are using.

However, it's important to note that a blood test alone is not usually sufficient to diagnose cancer. Cancer can often be difficult to diagnose, and a variety of tests and procedures may be needed to confirm the presence of cancer or to rule it out.There are several different types of blood tests that can be used to detect the presence of cancer or to help diagnose cancer. Some of these tests measure levels of specific proteins or substances in the blood that may be elevated in people with cancer. Other tests look for cancer cells or abnormal DNA in the blood, which can sometimes be an early sign of cancer.If you have been experiencing symptoms such as dizziness, low or high blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and unexplained weight loss, it's important to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of different conditions, and it's important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. The provider will likely perform a physical examination and may order additional tests, such as a blood test, to help determine the cause of your symptoms.",1,medicine

I had asthma when I was very young but had outgrown it. The finding said no acute infiltrations slight coarsening of the bronchovascular markings. The costophrenic angles are sharp heart not enlarged aorta is uncoiled. Can you tell me what all this means,"Based on the information provided, it sounds like the chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. Instead, the doctor mentioned that you have asthmatic bronchitis, which is a condition in which the airways in the lungs (the bronchi) become inflamed due to asthma. The X-ray may have shown slight coarsening of the bronchovascular markings, which refers to the small lines and patterns that can be seen on the X-ray and represent the bronchi and blood vessels in the lungs. The costophrenic angles, which are the corners formed by the ribs and the lining of the lung, are described as being sharp, which is a normal finding. The heart is not enlarged and the aorta, which is the main blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body, is uncoiled, which means it is not twisted or turned in an abnormal way. Overall, it appears that the X-ray showed no significant abnormalities or concerns. It is important to note that X-rays can only show the structure of the organs and tissues in the body, and they may not always be able to detect certain conditions or diseases. It is always important to follow up with your doctor and discuss any questions or concerns you may have about your health.",1,medicine

Is there a way to lower cpk level?  I weigh 400+ pound so perdiosine (?) is not an option.","Elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) can be caused by several factors, including muscle damage, inflammation, and certain medications. In people with type 2 diabetes, elevated CPK levels may be due to muscle damage resulting from poorly controlled blood sugar levels or complications such as neuropathy (nerve damage) or nephropathy (kidney damage). For example, if high blood sugar is causing muscle damage, your doctor may recommend changes to your diabetes management plan or medications to help lower your blood sugar levels.Rest: If muscle damage is the cause of elevated CPK levels, rest can help the muscles heal and lower CPK levels.Exercise: Regular exercise can help strengthen muscles and reduce the risk of muscle damage. However, if you have elevated CPK levels due to muscle damage, it's important to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise program.Diet: Eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes enough protein can help support muscle health and may help lower CPK levels.Medications: In some cases, your doctor may prescribe medications to help lower CPK levels.

It is also possible for rapid tests to produce false positive results, although this is less common.It is important to note that a positive result on a rapid antibody test does not necessarily mean that you are currently infected.

YYYY@YYYY","Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. The treatment of Lyme disease typically involves the use of antibiotics, which are effective at killing the bacteria and helping to resolve the infection.The specific treatment recommendations for Lyme disease may vary depending on the stage and severity of the infection, as well as the overall health of the patient. It is important that he take the medication as directed and complete the full course of treatment to ensure that the infection is fully resolved. If he is experiencing any side effects or other problems with the medication, it is important to let his healthcare provider know.In addition to the antibiotics, you may want to consider other supportive measures to help your husband recover from the infection. These may include rest, hydration, and a healthy diet. Some people also find relief from certain complementary therapies, such as turmeric and probiotics, although there is limited scientific evidence to support their use in the treatment of Lyme disease.It is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment or supplement, to ensure that it is safe and appropriate for your husband's individual needs and medical history.",1,medicine

It's important to try to identify the underlying cause of the low appetite in order to determine the appropriate treatment.If your grandchild has been sick and has diarrhea, it's possible that her low appetite is related to the illness. In this case, it's important to make sure that she is getting enough fluids to prevent dehydration, as diarrhea can cause fluid loss. Giving her Gatorade and milk can help to replenish fluids and electrolytes, but it's also important to try to get her to eat a well-balanced diet to provide the nutrients she needs for her body to recover.If your grandchild's appetite does not improve after a few days or if she continues to have diarrhea, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance. The healthcare professional will be able to assess your grandchild's overall health and determine if there are any underlying issues that need to be addressed.In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help increase your grandchild's appetite:Offer small, frequent meals and snacks rather than three large meals. Children's appetites can vary from day to day, and they may be more likely to eat if they are offered smaller amounts of food more frequently.Offer a variety of healthy, appealing foods. Children are more likely to eat if they are offered a variety of foods that they find appealing.Encourage your grandchild to eat at regular mealtimes and create a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere at meal times.Avoid pressuring your grandchild to eat or forcing her to eat certain foods. This can make meal times stressful and may actually decrease her appetite.It's generally not necessary to take your grandchild off milk unless she has a specific allergy or intolerance. Milk is an important source of nutrients, including protein, calcium, and vitamin D, and it can be helpful in promoting healing and recovery after an illness. If you have concerns about your grandchild's diet or nutrition, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for guidance.",1,medicine

It's possible that the lump is a result of an infection or abscess in the mouth or throat, such as a tonsil abscess or a dental abscess. Other potential causes could include a glandular problem, such as a swollen salivary gland, or a cyst or tumor.

This can be caused by a number of factors, including muscle imbalances, ligament laxity, or structural abnormalities in the bones of the legs. In some cases, genu recurvatum may be present at birth, while in others it may develop over time due to underlying medical conditions or injuries.If your son is experiencing pain when his knees are bent backwards, it is important to have him evaluated by a healthcare provider. They will be able to determine the cause of the condition and recommend appropriate treatment, which may include physical therapy, exercises to strengthen the muscles around the knees, or possibly surgery.

Plz tell my. Give me good way.","Follicular studies, also known as follicle tracking or ovulation monitoring, involve monitoring the growth and development of the ovarian follicles, which contain the eggs. The results of a follicular study can provide useful information about the timing of ovulation and the potential for pregnancy. However, it is important to note that there are many factors that can influence a person's fertility and their chances of getting pregnant, and a follicular study alone is not a reliable predictor of pregnancy.There are a few things that can be gleaned from the information you provided about your follicular study. It appears that you have one functioning ovary, as there is no mention of a left ovary. On days 9, 11, 13, and 15 of your cycle, the size of the follicles in your right ovary increased, with the largest follicle measuring 9.8mm on day 15. This suggests that ovulation may have occurred around this time or shortly thereafter.It is also worth noting that the size of the follicles and the timing of ovulation can vary from cycle to cycle, and what is considered ""normal"" can vary from person to person. You may also want to consider speaking with a healthcare provider or a fertility specialist to discuss any potential fertility issues and receive guidance on how to increase your chances of getting pregnant.",1,medicine

Bruising can occur when the soft tissues (such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments) are damaged by a blow or impact. It is usually not necessary to have surgery for a bruised metatarsal, as the injury typically heals on its own over time. However, if you are experiencing severe pain or if the injury is not improving after a few days, it may be necessary to consult with a healthcare provider or specialist to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In the meantime, you can try using ice and over-the-counter pain medication, elevating your foot, and resting as much as possible to help manage the pain and promote healing.",1,medicine
